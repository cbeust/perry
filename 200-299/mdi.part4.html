  Conquest of Time <BR><I>William Voltz</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>Disguised as Alarians 
and with the support of Tannwander (carefully hypnotized by Lenoir), Rhodan 
learns that Nevis-Latan plans to retire for some time in his submarine to go 
scuba-diving. They decide they will use this opportunity to capture him. 
Meanwhile, the Khrest III is hiding close to a nearby star, informed of the 
progress of the small team of nine persons led by Rhodan on Lemuria. They 
happily welcome the news that a Master of the Island was identified, but only 
Ichot Tolot doesn't seem to share their enthusiasm. Asked about this, he says 
the presence of Nevis-Latan on Lemuria precisely in this time and place is 
highly suspicious. He suspects a new trap laid out by the Masters of the Island 
to capture them once for all. 
<P>John Marshall set out in a Mosquito and heads for Lemuria, in order to let 
Rhodan know about Icho Tolot's deductions. He manages to send a compressed 
message and get Rhodan acknowledgement just before being destroyed by the 
Lemurian's air defenses, and heads back safely to the Khrest III. 
<P>Rhodan maintains the initial plan : they will capture Nevis Latan on board of 
his submarine. Gucky and Kakuta are assigned this dangerous mission, and will 
have to teleport into the submarine and neutralize the Master of the Island (now 
known to have powerful defenses against psychic attacks, as Rhodan learned when 
the previous Master was killed some time ago). Both mutants teleport into the 
submarine and are able to neutralize the Master of the Island a split second 
before he activates his defenses. The other seven members of the team invest the 
submarine. 
<P>Back to consciousness, Nevis Latan displays the usual morgue and 
self-confidence toward Rhodan. He has no doubt about the robustness of his 
psychic block and doesn't fear Rhodan's mutants questionings. However, Atlan and 
Rhodan decide to use the psychobeamer [something I don't know how it was 
translated in English. It's a device that appeared in the very first issues of 
PR and that scans the deep recesses of someone's mind, often leaving them 
mentally dead]. The operation works, and Nevis Latan supplies vital information 
about how the temporal field works. 
<P>However, only Masters of the Island from the &quot;real time&quot; can 
activate it, so Rhodan needs to find a trick to lead them to teleport the Khrest 
III back into its time. He convinces Nevis Latan to tell his colleagues that 
some new telepathetic parasite has been discovered, and that a ship filled with 
them is about to leave Lemuria. These hypothetical parasites are able to 
harmlessly give their host telepathetic capabilities. The message is transmitted 
and the Masters of the Island from beyond time confirm that the ship will be 
sent back to &quot;real time&quot;. 
<P>Encouraged by the cooperation of Nevis Latan, PR decides to push a little 
further and starts questioning him about his people, who they are and where they 
live. Another mental block shows up and Nevis Latan is on the verge of becoming 
completely insane. Rhodan decides to leave the questions aside for the moment. 
<P>They reintegrate the Khrest III and head for the location of the temporal 
field. The ship is set to maximal alert before making the transition, Rhodan 
being almost certain that a trap is awaiting them. The transfer through time 
happens, and as soon as it reappears, the Khrest III devastates Vario and its 
temporal station. The attack seems to have taken the Lemurians and the Tefrodians 
completely unaware. The Khrest III makes its way through the Tefrodian fleet and 
enters linear space, heading back home. With Vario and its temporal station 
destroyed, the MI have no way to communicate with their time agents. It's the 
first positive score for the Terrans in their fight against the Masters of the 
Islands. 
<P>Rhodan resumes Nevis Latan's questioning and pushes it further. The mental 
block is immediately activated, and is too strong for the brain of Nevis Latan. 
The only information Rhodan gets before Nevis Latan dies is the number of 
Masters of the Island left : seven. Given the conditions under which this 
information was obtained, Rhodan is unsure about its value, though. 
<P>Perry Rhodan heads back for Androbeta, more than ever decided to uncover the 
secrets of the Masters of the Islands, but unaware that a new threat has emerged 
in the very heart of his empire while he was absent. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>280 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>Die Weltraumdetektive greifen 
  ein</FONT></B> <BR>The Space Detective Grab on. <BR><I>H. G. 
Ewers</I></BLOCKQUOTE>Perry is back home in Androbeta after successfully 
destroying the time station that had cast them back in time on Vario/Lemuria. He 
is getting ready to see his wife, the Plophosian Mory Abro, who announced her 
arrival to see him after such a long time. She is not coming alone, though : 
Homer G. Adams is accompanying her, and Rhodan knows that there must be a good 
reason if he decided to leave Terrania. 
<P>In the same time, the Galactic Engineer Kalak unexpectedly materializes in 
Androbeta. Kalak had been asked by Rhodan to roam the fringe of Andromeda and 
let them know if any move from the Masters of the Island is detected. All 
sensors indicate that a precipitate hyperjump forced him to leave his assigned 
mission. When he reaches Androbeta, Kalak tells Rhodan that he was forced to 
flee because the Tefrodians were massing a huge fleet of ships on the verge of 
the galaxy. 
<P>In the Milky Way, two private investigators, Mc Kay and Marat land on planet 
Oyun, where they must contact one of their agents. They found him dead and are 
both kidnapped separately shortly after. 
<P>In Androbeta, Homer G. Adams speaks in front of the Terran leaders. He 
draws their attention on the fact that the Andromeda campaign is costing a lot 
of money to the government. However, this is not the reason why he rallied 
Androbeta. Recently, fake money has been flooding through the thousand worlds 
that are part of the Terran empire. The Terran money is made of a metal 
extracted from a planet whose location is kept secret, and which is fiercely 
guarded by robots and ships. Perry Rhodan is stunned to see that the fake money 
is indeed indistinguishable from the original one. The Empire is on the edge of 
financial breakdown. 
<P>Back on Oyun, Mc Kay and Marat manage to capture one of their kidnappers but 
the building blows up and they barely escape. Their prisoner dies in the 
explosion. They were able to pick a clue, though, that indicates that the plot 
is originating from Yales Inc, a financial organization based in the capital. 
This company seems to be involved somehow in the fake money. 
<P>Meanwhile, Rhodan left Gleam and is back on Terrania through the Lost World 
giant transmitter. Terran's experts are at a loss understanding how the money 
could be counterfeited. However, one of them gives the key to the riddle to 
Rhodan by mentioning that all the fake bank notes are similar as far as their 
imperfections. It then occurs to Rhodan that the Tefrodian's multiduplicator 
device might be at work, although he never considered it could be used on 
something else than live beings. Reginald Bell then contacts Rhodan to let him 
know he will be shortly joining him with two investigators that might have 
valuable information regarding the affair. 
<P>On their way to Terra, Bell, McKay and Marat are attacked by four humans 
bearing the uniform of the Galactic Defense, in the very heart of the Terran 
administration. They manage to get rid of them and the subsequent discovery of 
the dead bodies of the &quot;original&quot; guards will confirm that the 
Tefrodians have a foothold in the very heart of the empire, and worse, that they 
brought a multiduplicator with them. The economy of the Empire is collapsing, 
the solar is no longer considered as valuable money and people, led by 
Springers, are resorting to swapping of goods to buy things. 
<P>Rhodan has all the mutants, currently on Kahalo, sent back to Terra in order 
to secure his surroundings. They are the only ones who can detect duplicates, 
and still, it is a long process. An extraordinary session of the Terran 
worlds is set up, and Rhodan is very close to being voted down, but after 
explaining exactly what forces are at work and how dangerous the threat posed by 
the Masters of the Island is, he is finally maintained at the head of the 
Empire. At the very last moment of his speech, he barely escapes being shot, 
thanks to Gucky and Saar Lun, the Modul. The author of the attempt is a 
well-known member of the Galactic Defense, and there is but one conclusion to 
draw : he was duplicated and the mutants were not able to detect him. The head 
council of Terra is now most likely infested with Andromedan clones, and Rhodan 
has no way to find them. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>281 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>Kampf in der Tiefsee</FONT></B> 
  <BR>Battle in the Deep Sea <BR><I>H. G. Ewers</I></BLOCKQUOTE>After Homer Adams 
depicts the dramatic situation in the Empire, Perry Rhodan realizes that his 
financial advisor is at his wits end and needs a complete rest before he can be 
operational again. With Homer's agreement, Rhodan sends him to a specialized 
hospital where he will hopefully be able to recover from the recent pressure 
that was put on him. Marat and McKay, the two detectives that uncovered the 
counterfeiters on Oyun in the previous episode, are assigned the delicate task 
to watch after him and make sure the Tefrodians agents don't get a chance to kill 
him or replace him with a clone (less likely option since Homer bears a cell 
activator). 
<P>The secret clinic is located at the bottom of a very deep sea, not far away 
from the lost Lemuria continent that sank 50,000 years ago. On their arrival, a 
singer in a night-club is murdered. It turns out she was actually a Terran 
agent, so the two detectives are immediately on guard. They decide not to leave 
Adams one second alone. They are both quickly seduced by women working there, 
and however wary they are, McKay is found later unconscious in his room. He 
won't remember anything except having been invited to drink a whisky with a 
woman. They come to the conclusion that he was hypnotized. Adams is still here, 
wearing his activator. 
<P>Meanwhile, Rhodan is taking steps to avoid the complete devaluation of the 
Empire currency. He creates state banks where all the money used to pay workers 
is to be deposited. This measure solves a part of the problem, but no solution 
exists to track down all the fake money that keeps pouring through the empire, 
since it can't be distinguished from the original one. 
<P>Worried about Adams' whereabouts, Atlan joins the hospital and contacts the 
detectives. When told about the recent events, the detectives feel that Atlan is 
suspicious about something but he won't tell them anything. McKay and Adams go 
hunting. As they are fighting against one of the monstrous animals that dwell in 
the depths, Adams disappears with the submarine and leaves McKay alone. McKay 
triggers the alarm and just as Atlan is about to come to the rescue, the 
submarine reappears, with Adams on board, apparently in good shape. Atlan asks 
McKay not to disclose his presence in the hospital to Adams. 
<P>Back in the base, a bomb explodes and Atlan is almost killed in the 
explosion. He decides to get back to Terrania and informs Rhodan that he 
suspects Adams to have been replaced by a clone. An operation is set up with all 
the mutants (who have all been recalled from various places in both galaxies in 
the meantime) to identify the Tefrodians and their alleged base in the vicinity 
of the secret clinic on Guam. 
<P>Meanwhile, in the Perseids Cluster, five hundred light years away from Sol, a 
Springer ship is spotted by a Terran vessel, and when asked to stop for a 
routine inspection, tries to escape. He is quickly neutralized and captured. On 
board, the Terran captain finds spare pieces of unknown origin. When the 
incident is brought before the Terran leaders, it turns out the pieces are 
supposed to fit in a Tefrodian multiduplicator. The destination of the Springer 
vessel is the third planet of the Iago sun. 
<P>In the base, the trap for the fake Adams is laid out. McKay escorts him for 
another seahunting session, and Lemy Danger silently trails them. Adams 
neutralizes McKay with a gas and heads for the Tefrodian base. Once there, McKay 
is imprisoned and questioned. When he was about to be disposed of, he receives 
the unexpected help from a deserter Tefrodian. In the meantime, the Terran 
forces have begun to invade the base with the help of the mutants (the Tefrodians 
didn't think there were any mutants left on Terrania and therefore, were caught 
unaware). A bomb supposed to destroy the whole base is disarmed, and Rhodan 
finally conquers it. 
<P>A lot of fake money is discovered, along with a multiduplicator device. This 
is a partial victory for the Terrans, since the real Adams is nowhere to be 
found. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>282 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>Die Spur zu Jagos Stern</FONT></B> 
  <BR>The Trail to Jago's Star <BR><I>Clark Darlton</I></BLOCKQUOTE>Whereas Perry 
Rhodan is busy traveling throughout the Empire to prepare the citizens to the 
suspected forthcoming offensive from the Masters of the Island, Gucky has been 
alerted by the Springer incident, who was arrested with unknown material on his 
board, which turned out to be spare pieces for a multiduplicator. With the 
permission of Rhodan and a plophosian ship lent to him by Mori Abro, Gucky sets 
sail to Jago 3, with Wuriu Sengu and Andre' Lenoir on board, pretty confident 
that this planet might be a secret base of the Masters of the Island. 
<P>On their arrival there, they learn about foreign ships that were spotted 
recently by one of the colons. They start their investigation in the mountain 
where the ships landed, and quickly feel that something is wrong because none of 
them is able to fully exploit their mutant capabilities : Gucky is having a hard 
time teleporting, and Sengu senses some resistance in the ground below their 
feet beyond which he can't seem to &quot;see&quot; anything. This is enough clue 
for Gucky who decides to ring the alarm and report to Rhodan that he uncovered a 
Tefrodian base. 
<P>Rhodan takes the incident very seriously and quickly decides a raid on the 
base. But he insists on the offensive being as harmless as possible, so that 
they can gather as much information on the Masters of the Islands stand in the 
Milky Way as possible. The attack is planned on midnight, and Gucky is given a 
tank of sleeping gas which he must spread throughout the base before the 
Terrans attack, so that the base can be captured intact. 
<P>Gucky teleports into the base and as soon as he arrives, realizes that he can 
no longer teleport, nor use any other mutant skills. Worried, he nevertheless 
proceeds to find the main air dispatcher in order to leave the tank there. After 
some difficulty, he manages to find it and opens the valves of the tank. 
<P>A few minutes after the gas has started to propagate, his abilities are 
restored, and he immediately feels a greater resistance to his parapsychic scan 
in a precise point in the base. He teleports there and finds out the central 
point of the base, where a Master of the Island is busy watching the monitors 
displaying the Terran attack. A matter transmitter is sitting in the middle 
of the room. 
<P>Gucky enters the room and asks the Master of the Island to surrender. 
Surprised but not worried, the man turns to Gucky, watches him for a moment, and 
then walks toward the transmitter, confident in his shield protecting him from 
Gucky's weapon. Gucky has no choice but destroying the transmitter. When the man 
sees the transmitter turn into molten metal, some panic shows in his eyes, and 
he takes advantage of the blast to disappear. Gucky chases him through the base 
but eventually loses him. The Master of the Island jumps into a ship and easily 
breaks through the Terran fleet, before vanishing into linear space. 
<P>Meanwhile, the base if successfully captured by the Terrans, and its self 
destruction is avoided in the nick of time by a patrol of robots. A 
multiduplicator is found, along with heaps of fake money. Among the prisoners is 
an Anti, who seems to possess much more information than what he tries to make 
believe. During the final debriefing, Gucky informs Rhodan of a suspicion he had 
during this mission. 
<P>A matter transmitter as powerful as the one he destroyed, and probably 
connected somewhere in the Great Void, and maybe even to Andromeda, is a huge 
device, which roots go very deep into the ground, and probably even occupies a 
big part of the base itself. The only possible conclusion is the the Masters of 
the Island must have invented a way to reach the Milky Way without needing a 
matter transmitter, or this transmitter couldn't have been brought here in the 
first place. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>283 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>Flucht vom Giftplaneten</FONT></B> 
  <BR>Flight from the Poison Planet <BR><I>Kurt Mahr</I></BLOCKQUOTE>Four months 
have passed since the Jago operation. Homer G. Adams is held prisoner with five 
other key characters of the Terran administration on an unknown ammoniac 
planet, allegedly in the Milky Way. The intentions of the Tefrodians are unclear 
at that point, they don't seem to be really interested in questioning them. The 
Terrans suppose that the only point in their captivity is that the Masters of 
the Islands replaced them with duplicates, who must now have deeply infiltrated 
the Terran govermnent. 
<P>A guard comes to take them before the commandant of the base. The first shock 
is the identity of this person : he is a duplicate of Homer G. Adams himself. 
The commandant of the base introduces himself as Miras-Etrin, and he quickly 
admits he is a Master of the Island. The prisoners are taken back to their room 
and one of them, the general Strugov, begins to suspect that Miras-Etrin did not 
decide to unveil himself without a reason. Strugov is eventualy convinced that 
at least one of them is a duplicate, who took the place of the original 
prisoner, and who must be reporting all the captives plans to the Master of the 
Island. He decides to trust Homer G. Adams and together, they proceed to 
question discretely the other four prisoners in order to find out who the 
traitor(s) might be. 
<P>The manoeuver bears fruits : the duplicate is identified (Weinstein) and is 
unfortunately killed in the fray. Miras-Etrin immediately comes to see them, 
gets the dead body back and lets the original Weinstein join his comrades. Of 
course, the Terrans immediately suspect the newcomer to be a duplicate as well, 
but they won't have to work it out since the new Weinstein (Weinstein-3) turns 
himself in and immediately admits he's a clone. He then proceeds to explain why 
he decided to betray Miras-Etrin. 
<P>However blindly faithful to the Masters of the Island, the duplicates have a 
survival instinct and Weinstein-3 is well aware that another duplicate 
(Weinstein-2) is at work on the Earth, where he is infiltrating the Terran 
government. Whether Weinstein-2 succeeds or fails, Weinstein-3 will become 
useless (obviously, if Weinstein-2 is uncovered, the Terrans won't allow another 
duplicate to reiterate the substitution). Therefore, Weinstein-3 realized that 
his best chance is to rally the Terrans. Convinced but still suspecting another 
trap from Miras-Etrin, the Terrans accept him among them but decide to leave him 
out of all strategic decisions they might take. 
<P>Another duplicate contacts them, the duplicate of Adams (now referred to as 
&quot;Gershwin&quot;, which happens to be the &quot;G&quot; in Homer G. Adams). 
For the very same reasons as Weinstein-3, he wants to join the Terrans and 
proposes to help them escape if they can guarantee they will take him with them. 
He pretends having very valuable information on the layout of the base, which 
turns out to be true. 
<P>The Terrans can use a secret passage he made through the floor and from 
there, reach the main energy supply. A bomb will plunge the base into darkness 
and the ensuing confusion will allow them to steal a vehicle and reach the 
surface, where they will wait for rescue. How this rescue will come, the general 
Strugov won't explain but he volunteers to achieve it. 
<P>Strugov asks Gerschwin to bring a clone of himself (Strugov-3) to him. When 
they meet, Strugov knocks Strugov-3 down and takes his place, pretending he's 
now a duplicate. Spending some time among the numerous duplicates of all the 
prisoners, Strugov realizes they are very badly considered by their masters. 
They are also very carefully trained : Tefrodians keep them under a permanent 
surveilance and make them notice when their behavior strays from their 
original's. After behaving aggressively toward one of the guards, Strugov 
demands to be taken before Miras-Etrin, to which the guard complies. 
<P>Miras-Etrin seems puzzled to see a duplicate behave differently, and decides 
to hear what Strugov has to say. Strugov then explains that it is impossible to 
create accurate clones of important Terran personalities if they are 
permanently under the orders of guards. They need to work out their authority, 
otherwise only mild-mannered, and therefore unrealistic, persons will be 
created. Miras-Etrin admits not having been in the base long enough, and 
therefore he didn't think too much about this. But he seems to agree. Then 
Strugov makes his second move : he says he wants to be sent to Earth where he 
will replace his first duplicate, whom, he estimates, he outperforms now. 
Miras-Etrin says he will give him his decision shortly. 
<P>Meanwhile, the other prisoners are almost done setting up their escape, with 
the diligent help of Gerschwin. Some time later, Miras-Etrin lets Strugov know 
that he accepted, and therefore the general will be sent to Earth alone on a 
ship where he will replace Strugov-2. Everything goes smoothly : a bomb is 
placed in the energy supply and Strugov departs on board of a Tefrodian ship. 
Shortly after taking off, Strugov finds out that no escape pod is present on the 
ship, and suddenly, Miras-Etrin's holographic image appears before him. Strugov 
understands that he played and lost to stronger than him. 
<P>Miras-Etrin explains that he has never been fooled by any of their plots. 
Even the duplicates who assisted him didn't actually work for him. Miras-Etrin 
had simply anticipated their behavior and knew they would turn themselves in to 
the Terrans. The escape of the prisoners has worked perfectly, they are now 
roaming the ammoniac-filled surface, waiting a very unlikely help. The linear 
drive of Strugov's ship has been deactivated. Strugov has two options : either 
he tries to rally the Terran territory at subliminic speed, which he will 
reach in forty thousand years, or he tries to send a message. But then, a bomb 
will immediately blow the whole ship. 
<P>Mad with rage, Strugov controls himself and decides to cast one last jab at 
the Master of the Island. He says that even though he was able to suppress six 
Terrans, billions of others are still there, and that it only took them a few 
years to kill three of the seven Masters of the Island. And the other four will 
eventually fall (which is a bluff : so far, Rhodan can only suppose that there 
are only four Masters of the Island left, given the conditions in which this 
information was obtained). However, Miras-Etrin's reaction confirms the 
hypothese : he doesn't deny that there are only four of them left and 
disappears, leaving Strugov alone with his dilemma. 
<P>Strugov decides to try a third option : find the bomb. After some reasoning, 
he realizes that the bomb must necessarily be very close to the 
hypertransmitter. He eventually finds it in the first of the four spacesuits in 
the central command. He drops it in space and just as he is about to send a 
message, Miras-Etrin appears to him again, to congratulate him for finding one 
of the bombs he put on board. At first discouraged by the news, Strugov then 
realizes from the words used by the Master of the Island that he seems to have 
acted all alone (he despises the Tefrodians, who are merely servants to him). 
Therefore, he had very little time to put the bombs on board, and Strugov 
quickly deduces that Miras-Etrin had no way of guessing which spacesuit he would 
use. He takes the other three spacesuits, drops them into space and can then 
send his SOS safely. 
<P>Strugov and his companions have been rescued, but no duplicate is present. 
Adams then explains what happened : after Gucky and Ras Tschubai located them on 
the surface and teleported them back into a Terran ship, no duplicate made it 
through the teleportation. It seems that some hidden genetic characteristic of 
the duplicates prevents them from traveling through the fifth dimension. This 
information, added to the fact that Rhodan now knows for sure there are only 
four Masters of the Island, gives the Terrans a definite edge on their 
ennemies. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>284 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>Anschlag gegen die Erde</FONT></B> 
  <BR>Strike against Terra <BR><I>William Voltz</I></BLOCKQUOTE>Another summit 
conference is in the making. Perry Rhodan is more and more criticized and a 
growing part of the colonized worlds are thinking about voting him down from his 
position. Each world will send an ambassador to the conference. Rhodan expects 
another strike from the Masters of the Islands at this conference, and he is 
indeed right: Miras-Etrin is sending a hoard of duplicates toward Terra, in what 
he expects to be one last offensive that will bring the Terran empire to its 
knees. 
<P>Agents from the Secret Services are sent to escort each ambassador and keep 
them under a close surveillance. Al Boyer is one of them, and he quickly 
realizes that something is going on with the wife of Rabkob, the person he is in 
charge of. He suspects she might have been replaced by a clone, and his 
suspicion is confirmed when he finds a small metallic device in Rabkob's 
belonging. 
<P>He reports his finding to Rhodan who immediately sends all his mutants, 
asking them to search thoroughly and secretly all the ambassadors. The device 
turns out to be a part of a bigger machine, which purpose remains undetermined. 
The mutants eventually gather the thirty-two pieces of the device, which then 
assembles itself automatically, in the middle of Mercant's office. The machine 
is immediately taken away from Terrania and abandoned into space. After some 
time, the weapon hasn't done anything more than emitting harmless beams. 
<P>The scientists bring the machine back and eventually conclude that this 
device is harmless, and was most likely used as a bait to keep the Terran 
Defense busy as the conference date is closing in. Rhodan instructs the mutants 
to search for a second weapon, expected to be much harder to find. 
<P>Two mutants are found very heavily burned. Using spacesuits this time, the 
mutants keep searching and gather another round of pieces, each one guarded by a 
powerful radiant beam designed to kill whoever finds it. 
<P>Meanwhile, Boyer estimates that the fragments of this second weapon are still 
too easily found. He begins to suspect that the Masters of the Islands might 
once again be tricking the Terrans and a hypothese begins to take form. He 
contacts an old friend of his, who is working on the Moon with Nathan, the 
impotronic computer. He submits his hypothese and waits for the answer. 
<P>Meanwhile, the mutants have almost reconstituted the second weapon just as 
Nathan's answer arrives. It says that the second weapon is most likely another 
lure, and that Boyer's hypothese about a third weapon has 63% of being the right 
one... 
<BLOCKQUOTE>285 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>Die dritte Waffe</FONT></B> <BR>The 
  Third Weapon <BR><I>William Voltz</I></BLOCKQUOTE>The conference is now two days 
away, and Boyer is more than ever convinced that a third weapon is hidden 
somewhere. He decides to team with a Willy, the medusa-like beings that take 
care of the posbi protoplasm on the World of a Hundred Suns. He trusts the Willy 
and asks him to create diversions so that he can safely search the rooms of the 
participants. 
<P>Atlan is contacted by Boyer's former wife, also convinced of the existence of 
a third weapon, and decides to carry a search on his own, but Rhodan refuses to 
cancel the conference. Boyer and Atlan eventually join their forces but they 
can't find anything. 
<P>While examining the conference room, Boyer has an intuition and wonders if 
the TV cameras could hide this mysterious weapon, but then again, a thorough 
search reveals nothing. 
<P>A few thousand light years away from the Earth, Miras-Etrin is about to send 
a Tefrodian duplicate on a mission. The Tefrodian enters a minuscule ship and sets 
sail to the Earth. He must activate the bomb, which is supposed to destroy not 
only Terrania, but the whole Earth. The duplicate know he will die on the 
mission, so Miras-Etrin doesn't trust him. On its course to Earth, the ship 
breaks down. The duplicate goes out to examine the engines and then reads a 
message from Miras-Etrin saying that the Master of the Island simply wanted to 
make sure he could trust him. If he hadn't tried to fix the engine, Miras-Etrin 
would have sent another ship to complete the mission. 
<P>One of the participants is on her way to the conference, on the morning of 
the third of April, 2405. She has been suffering from pains in her stomach for 
the past hours but decides to go anyway. 
<P>Thanks to the small size of his ship (harldy bigger than himself), the 
Tefrodian duplicate arrives unseen in orbit around the Earth. He docks with a TV 
satellite and boards it. He then waits for the conference to begin. 
<P>Boyer can't forget about his intuition and questions the TV technicians. When 
asked to examine their logs, they report an inconspicuous, but admittedly 
uncommon, failure in one of their satellites the past hour. Boyer lets Atlan 
know about this. They rush into a ship and head for the satellite. 
<P>As Rhodan is beginning to speak, several participants suddenly feel violent 
pains in their stomach. Suddenly, spare parts of an unknown device escapes from 
their bodies and begins to assemble in the middle of the room, hovering several 
meters above the floor. Once assembled, the weapon is then immediately 
surrounded by a protection field. 
<P>Atlan and Boyer board the TV satellite a split second before the Tefrodian is 
able to activate the weapon. The Andromedan is killed during the fray, and the 
bomb is then taken to a safe place to be blown out. It turns out it's similar to 
Arkonid's bombs and that it would have ignited every single atom of hydrogen in 
the atmosphere.

  Ewers</I></BLOCKQUOTE>In Terrania, Rhodan is listening to a report from his 
chief financial officers. The situation is grim : the Terrans must give up 
Andromeda, or their economy will collapse. The discovery of a way to identify 
authentic bills from counterfeited ones is not enough to cover the expenses 
caused by the fleets patrolling in Andro-alpha and Androbeta. An urgent message 
is then announced to Rhodan, coming from Kahalo, the planet that controls the 
main transmitter to the other galaxy. Despite the oscillating field the Terrans 
put in place to close the access from Andromeda, a sphere has suddenly 
materialized within the transmitter. 
<P>Rhodan immediately leaves for Kahalo. The sphere is less than ten meters big, 
and it moved a distance of ten million kilometers since it was spotted. Rhodan 
dispatches five thousand ships and starts to hunt the sphere. But each time they 
close in, it suddenly departs and moves away. 
<P>It quickly turns out that the sphere is not using engines, but teleportation 
to move, a discovery that stuns the Terrans. 
<P>A small ship, with Saar-Lun the Modul on board, is part of the hunting raid. 
They anticipate the movement of the sphere and are able to dock their ship to it 
before it dematerializes again. Saar-Lun uses his paranormal abilities to fight 
againt the teleporters inside the sphere. They eventually crash on a planet, and 
three shiny red small spheres escape from the ship before the Terrans can react. 
They quickly disappear out of sight. 
<P>The Terran fleet quickly joins and the mutants proceed with the hunt. To the 
general surprise, the spheres eventually teleport back into space. Two of them 
then commit suicide into the nearby sun while the third one keeps running away, 
although obviously getting weaker and weaker. 
<P>The runaway sphere eventually materializes inside a Terran ship. It 
immediately teleports away but doing so, takes the commander of the ship with 
it. When he regains consciousness, he is astray in space, but spots a wrecked 
Maahk ship and gets on its board. There, he finds the sphere, too weak to go any 
further. He then communicates with it. 
<P>Rhodan and the officers quickly join him and learn about the sphere. It 
explains that the three of them were working on reactivating the &quot;Six 
Mothers&quot; (the six planets that constitute the Andromedan part of the 
transmitter) when suddenly, they were teleported here. When asked about their 
ability to reactivate the transmitter, the sphere says that they are the Solar 
Engineers, who created the Great Transmitters that bridge the Milky Way and 
Andromeda. Unlike what the Terrans thought, the Lemurians did not create those 
transmitters, but asked the Solar Engineers to do it. Naturally enclined to that 
kind of challenge, they complied and are now being used by the Masters of the 
Island to break through the Terran blocade. The sphere suddenly disappears and 
kills itself into the sun. 
<P>Rhodan knows that the Masters of the Island will eventually break through the 
transmitter and will then launch a massive invasion onto the Milky Way. 
Therefore, he decides to take the conflict directly on their grounds : in 
Andromeda. <BR>&nbsp;
