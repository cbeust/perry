  <BR>Meeting in Infinity <BR><I>Kurt Mahr</I></BLOCKQUOTE>May 2401. The Terrans 
discover by chance the dead body of a member of the Kitara's crew, which 
convinces Rhodan that the agents are really Maahk agents. Meanwhile, the 
duplicates start the Pulse Disruptor and materialize a Maahk ship inside the 
Milky Way. One of the Terran ships eventually discovers the Kitara and the enemy 
ship but fails to capture it. The Maahk ship disappears. In order to infiltrate 
the Terran ranks, Grek-1, the commandant of the Maahk vessel, leaves the five 
duplicates on the Kitara. They are rescued by the Terrans and explain that the 
Kitara was attacked by the Maahk ship and that they are the only suvivors. The 
Terrans pretend they believe them but Rhodan now knows for sure they are 
traitors. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>226 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>Die Parasprinter</FONT></B> <BR>The 
  Para-Sprinter <BR><I>K. H. Scheer</I></BLOCKQUOTE>Atlan suggests to use two new 
mutants, the brothers Rakar and Tronar Woolver. These two brothers come from 
Chrystal. They are linked by a very strong telepathetic connection and are able 
to teleport by following the energy fields between any two points in space. 
Using a stratagem, Rhodan causes the traitors to call by radio the Maahk ship. 
The two &quot;wave runners&quot; take advantage of the communication to teleport 
onto the Maahk ship. There, they find out about the multiduplicator devices, but 
Tronar is captured by the Maahks, who pass him through the multiduplicator 
before killing him. Rakar is able to flee.

Tronar's clone on Kahalo. But Grek-1 isn't aware that Rakar saw the 
multiduplicator and knows that his brother died on the ship. The Terrans 
neutralize the fake Tronar and Rakar takes his place. Meanwhile, on the Maahk 
ship, Grek-1 is setting up a huge Pulse Disruptor, which will be able to 
materialize a whole Maahk fleet within the Milky Way.

  <BR>The Revenge of the Mutants <BR><I>William Voltz</I></BLOCKQUOTE>Rakar 
Woolver eventually joins the Maahk ship, fooling Grek-1 about his identity. He 
sabotages the Pulse Disruptor, which causes the Maahk fleet to materialize in 
the Sextuple system, where the Terran fleet is awaiting them. They are 
exterminated.

  <BR>Enemy from a Strange Galaxy <BR><I>Clark Darlton</I></BLOCKQUOTE>June 2401. 
Despite the loss of his fleet, Grek-1 wants to keep on fighting. But his ideas 
have evolved : he realized he is not fighting against Arkonids (who are old 
enemies to his race) but against Terrans, against which he has no revenge 
desire. However, he holds grudges against the Akonids, who are close to 
Arkonids. The hostility of the Akonids toward Rhodan convinces him to ally with 
the Terrans. After many discussions through the mutants, he surrenders to the 
Terrans, but blows his own ship up before doing so. In the same time, a strange 
phenomenon related to the special skills of the two wave runners causes the 
resurrection of Tronar Woolver. 230 - Finale für Twin <BR>The End of Twin <BR>H. 
G. Ewers 
<P>Grek-1 is taken to the Moon where he is questioned by Rhodan. Meanwhile, the 
Akonids learn about the Sextuple system and demand that the Terrans free the way 
through the transmitter. Moreover, they gather a fleet of 80,000 ships to impose 
their presence in the area. On Grek-1's recommendation, Rhodan evacuates the 
Sexutple system and opens the way to the Akonids, but he traps the Raum/Quinta 
station. The Akonids enter the Twin system and try to capture Raum/Quinta, but 
they then face a Maahk fleet coming from Horror, on its way to take on the Milky 
Way. Rhodan destroys Raum/Quinta, which isolates indefinitely the Maahk and 
Akonid fleets in the Twin system. The Akonids lose almost the entirety of their 
fleet and won't be a threat to the Solar Empire before a long time.

  <BR>The System of the Lost <BR><I>Kurt Mahr</I></BLOCKQUOTE>December 2401. 
Grek-1, now among the Terran ranks, tells Rhodan about a solar system halfway 
between the Milky Way and Andromeda, the Lost System, where a transmitter can be 
found, which is connected to that of the Sextuple system. This system had only 
one planet, Kulloch, populated by Maahks, but the Masters of the Island blew the 
planet a thousand years ago because the Maahks had rebelled against them. The 
system is now therefore desert. Rhodan goes there with the Khrest II and finds 
out that some Maahks survived the destruction of the planet and live among its 
debris. They are very aggressive toward Rhodan because they think the Masters of 
the Island are back, and they prevent the Terrans from reaching the transmitter, 
located on one of the debris. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>232 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>Die Zeitfalle</FONT></B> <BR>The Time 
  Trap <BR><I>Clark Darlton</I></BLOCKQUOTE>Rhodan asks Bell to join him with his 
fleet and together, they face and defeat the Maahks. But as they come nearer to 
the transmitter, Gucky's ship triggers a time trap, and he is cast one thousand 
years back in time, while the Masters of the Island were attacking the planet. 
Thanks to Gucky, the Masters of the Islands suffer heavy losses and some of the 
Maahks manage to survive. Gucky is able to come back into the present, and 
Rhodan is finally able to make peace with the Maahks by convincing them they 
were not sent by the Masters of the Island. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>233 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>Geheimsatellit Troja</FONT></B> 
  <BR>Secret Satellite: Troja <BR><I>K. H. Scheer</I></BLOCKQUOTE>July 2402. Using 
the transmitter of the Lost System, the Terrans are teleported into the 
micro-nebula Androbeta, 400,000 light years away. This micro-nebula, which looks 
like Androalpha, orbits around the Andromeda galaxy. In order not to draw 
attention upon them, the Terrans build a base inside an asteroid (Troja) found 
within the Lost System. Inside, he stores five super-cruisers, including the 
Khrest II, and sends the asteroid through the transmitter. Troya reaches a the 
system of Beta-Triangle, and Rhodan's plan is a success : the guardians of the 
Androbeta transmitter are not alerted by this innocent-looking asteroid, 
probably captured by mistake by the transmitter. 
<P>Some time later, the asteroid is swallowed by a Moby, a kind of living 
planet. These Mobies are the super-guardians of Androbeta, and wander about the 
nebula, swallowing everything that goes by. As they are about to be 
&quot;digested&quot;, the Terrans kill the planetoid from inside and are able to 
escape. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>234 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>Wachkommando Andro-Beta</FONT></B> 
  <BR>Sentry Post: Andro-Beta <BR><I>H. G. Ewers</I></BLOCKQUOTE>Rhodan leave 
Troja with the Khrest II on an exploration mission. After visiting an ice 
planet, where strange hallucinogen crystals grow [note from Cedric : these 
hypno-crystals will appear again in another cycle where they will have a great 
importance], the Khrest II approaches a wandering Moby which doesn't seem to 
react to their presence. It turns out most of the Mobies are dead, and their 
&quot;dead body&quot; is used as homes by a race called the Two-Noses. They are 
almost humanoid and are the main people of Androbeta. Using a powerful tractor 
beam, the Two-Noses capture the Khrest II and all the Terrans. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>235 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>Die Kaster der WeiBrüssel</FONT></B> 
  <BR>The Boxes of the White Trunk <BR><I>William Voltz</I></BLOCKQUOTE>The 
Two-Noses are divided in three races, identified by the color of their two 
snout-looking noses (red, blue and white). Rhodan makes believe to the Red Noses 
(the upper race) that the Terrans came from a planet in Androbeta and have just 
discovered space travel. Deeming them as primitives, the Red Noses send them 
into the deep recesses of the Moby, with the White Noses (the lower race). 
<BLOCKQUOTE>236 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>Im Camp der Gesetzlosen</FONT></B> 
  <BR>In the Camp of the Lawless <BR><I>William Voltz</I></BLOCKQUOTE>The Terrans 
are used for some time as farm workers. Eventually, Rhodan makes them rebel 
against the upper races. The Terrans take advantage of the civil war to get back 
to the Khrest II and escape from the Moby. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>237 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>Die drei Sternenbrüder</FONT></B> 
  <BR>The Three Star-Brothers <BR><I>Kurt Mahr</I></BLOCKQUOTE>August 2402. 
Reginal Bell, who commands the solar fleet of the Lost System, sends additional 
cruisers to Androbeta. These cruisers are fit with super-engines that can cross 
the 400,000 light years that separate the micro-nebula from the Lost Word. Thus, 
they don't need the transmitter. When they reach Androbeta, they are confronted 
to an apparently dead Moby, but actually inhabited by some sort of intelligence 
existing in three instances, issued from the decaying brain of the Moby. 
Meanwhile, in the Two-Noses Moby, the civil war is still raging. Atlan 
eventually decides to blow the Moby up, for fear that their war might attract 
the Masters of the Island's attention. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>238 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>Der Geleitzug ins 
  Ungewisse</FONT></B> <BR>The Convoy into the Unknown <BR><I>K. H. 
Scheer</I></BLOCKQUOTE>The Khrest II gets back to Troja, where it is joined by 
the cruisers sent by Bell. Rhodan is looking for a discrete planet where the 
Terrans could build a base. He finds it in the Ha'lurin system, on the second 
planet -- Artis, an ice world. The Terrans build the base under the ice, but one 
of the cruisers is spotted by a Two-Noses squadron. The cruiser successfully 
evades the Two-Noses, making them think it actually came from Androalpha, the 
Maahks micro-nebula. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>239 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>Welt unter heiBliger 
  Strahlung</FONT></B> <BR>World under Intense Radiation <BR><I>Clark 
Darlton</I></BLOCKQUOTE>September 2402. Rhodan decides to explore the first 
planet of the Ha'lurin system. It is baptized Destroy and looks like it was 
devastated by a nuclear holocaust. Pushing the investigation further, Rhodan is 
stunned to discover Laurins dwelling beneath the surface. This confirms the 
origin of the Laurins, which had always been suspected to come from Andromeda. 
The Masters of the Islands sent the Laurins to invade the Galaxy three centuries 
ago. After the Laurins failed, the Masters of the Islands exiled them on 
Destroy, and then destroyed the planet. The surviving Laurins are now hiding to 
escape from the Masters. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>240 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>An der Schwelle der Hölle</FONT></B> 
  <BR>At the Threshhold of Hell <BR><I>H. G. Ewers</I></BLOCKQUOTE>A strange 
hyperwave is beginning to irradiate through Androbeta. This hyperwaves wakes all 
the Mobies up and they start to destroy methodically all the inhabited planets 
of the micro-galaxy. It seems that the Masters of the Islands eventually 
suspected the presence of the Terrans and are going to great lengths to make 
sure they won't survive. A Moby attacks and destroys Destroy, and then moves on 
to Artis, but the Terrans are able to eliminate it thanks to the para-sprinters 
(the Woolver brothers). But they know all they did was gaining some time 
<P>Meanwhile, after a parapsychic experience, an OSU officer is transfered for a 
few hours into a parallel universe where he meets with a telepathetic robot on 
some dark planet. This robot explains that he has been waiting for his masters 
for a thousand years, but the Terran can't learn anything more. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>241 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>Fünf von der Crest</FONT></B> 
  <BR>Five from the Khrest <BR><I>William Voltz</I></BLOCKQUOTE>The Terrans must 
abandon Artis to the Mobies. They relocate on Androbeta's fringe. The Khrest II 
scientists calculate that there are nine possible sources in Androbeta from 
which the hyperwave can be emitted. Rhodan sends nine mosquitos (small and fast 
ships) to investigate these spots. Eight ships find nothing of interest but the 
eighth one discovers a system made of three aligned stars, called the Triad 
system. Around the central star orbits the planet Gleam [Cedric: probably called 
the Swamp Planet and renamed by our restless and always creative French 
translator. And to an English name on top of that :-)] 
<BLOCKQUOTE>242 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>Das Rätsel des 
  Sumpfplaneten</FONT></B> <BR>The Riddle of the Swamp Planet <BR><I>William 
  Voltz</I></BLOCKQUOTE>The exploration of Gleam reveals that the hypertransmitter 
is on Siren, a satellite of Gleam, that was made invisible by the Masters of the 
Island. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>243 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>Raumaufklärer 008</FONT></B> 
  <BR>Space Scout: 008 <BR><I>Kurt Mahr</I></BLOCKQUOTE>October 2402. Rhodan 
decides to destroy Siren, which is now guarded by a fleet of Two-Noses. The 
Terrans capture a Two-Noses vessel and can safely approach Siren. Thanks to the 
teleporters, Siren is destroyed with its emitter. The Mobies stop living 
throughout the nebula. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>244 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>Die Kugel aus Zeit und 
  Raum</FONT></B> <BR>The Bead out of Time and Space <BR><I>Clark 
Darlton</I></BLOCKQUOTE>The way to Androbeta is free again. Rhodan returns to 
Troja, still drifting in the micro-nebula, in order to find another planet where 
a new base could be built. The Terrans then realize that all the Two-Noses are 
fleeing from Androbeta, abandoning their bases and their planets. Rhodan decides 
to settle in Androbeta anyway and picks Gleam as their main base. This decision 
causes IT to appear, and He informs Rhodan that this capital decision will take 
him to Andromeda and will later lead to the destruction of a &quot;great 
race&quot;. On Gleam, the Terrans find Harno, their old spheric friend, who 
assists them in chasing psychic creatures causing them difficulties. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>245 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>Notrufe aus dem Nichts</FONT></B> 
  <BR>Distress Call out of the Void <BR><I>K. H. Scheer</I></BLOCKQUOTE>November 
2402. The mutants hear a powerful psychic call for help. The scientists locate 
the emission on a distant planet, called Margin, on the edge of Androbeta. 
Rhodan goes there and finds a whole living planet, made of protoplasm. Ships 
sent by the Masters of the Island regularly show up, take a portion of the 
protoplam, and leave, causing a great pain to the protoplasm being. Talking with 
the planet, Rhodan finds out that Margin is actually the original protoplasm 
that created the Posbis and their homeworld, the World-of-the-Hundred-Suns. 
Willing to keep the promise he made to the Posbis in 2114, Rhodan tries to help 
the planet by fighting its exploiters, but it fails, and the Masters of the 
Islands choose to destroy the protoplasmic planet. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>246 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>Kontrollstation Modul</FONT></B> 
  <BR>Control Stations: Modul <BR><I>H. G. Ewers</I></BLOCKQUOTE>Actually, the 
Masters of the Islands have decided to completely destroy Androbeta. Numerous 
suicide ships are sent against all the planets, where they crash and kill the 
population. Rhodan discovers that the pilots of these suicide ships are 
androids, but not from Andromeda. The robots are created on a lonely planet 
between Andromeda and Androbeta called Tenebria. The Terrans move to Tenebria 
but are repelled by missiles. A small commando manages to break through and 
reaches the surface of the planet. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>247 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>Der Herr der Androiden</FONT></B> 
  <BR>The Master of the Androids <BR><I>H. G. Ewers</I></BLOCKQUOTE>Tenebria is 
under the commandment of Saar-Lun, a Modul. The Moduls were once one of the 
humanoid races of Andromeda, but they were enslaved by the Masters of the 
Island. Saar-Lun has a specific skill that allows him to turn energy into 
matter. The Masters of the Island force him to use his power to give life to the 
androids, created on Tenebria out of pieces of protoplasm taken on Margin. 
Saar-Lun hates the Masters of the Islands, but he is perduaded that if he 
rebels, the Masters will exterminate his whole race. So, he fights against the 
Terrans until Rhodan proves him that the Masters of the Island have already 
exterminated his race, and that he is the last of them. Saar-Lun surrenders and 
joins the Terrans. He stops producing the androids and the suicide raids stop. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>248 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>Unter Einsatz seines

Terrans are now the masters of Androbeta. But on Androalpha, the Maahks are 
getting more active. Grek-1 suggests that he should go spying on Androcenter, 
the main planet of the Maahks. There, he learns that the Masters of the Island 
asked the Maahks to check out all chain of transmitters that give access to 
Andromeda. Grek-1 is eventually spotted as a spy, but before being killed, he 
creates a rebellion among the Maahks, some of them willing to be freed from the 
reign of the Masters of the Island.

  <BR>The Ghost of the Machine <BR><I>Kurt Mahr</I></BLOCKQUOTE>December 2402. 
Thanks to Grek-1's sacrifice, Rhodan can let Bell know about the imminent 
arrival of the Maahks in the Lost System. Bell can resist several attacks, and 
the Terrans finally block the transmitter so that only them can use it. The 
chain of the transmitters is under complete Terran control : the Masters of the 
Islands are now besieged in their own galaxy.
