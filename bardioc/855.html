Boyt Margor tells his story to the psychologist...
<p>
<em>
In 3491, Virna Maloy, a resident from Gaia, followed a Karzel-Kold, a Vincranian, inside Provcon-Faust.  Karzel-Kold wanted to investigate the Zwottans, a civilization that creates objects called psychods using their mental forces.
<p>
A year later, Virna Maloy gave birth to a child who seemed to be influenced by the psychods.  She went back on Gaia but left the child with the Zwottans.  Six years later, a Vincranian brought the child back to Virna Maloy, who baptized him Boyt Margor.  Soon, the boy started showing powerful parapsychic abilities.
<p>
After his mother's death, Boyt Margor decided to use his skills to create a power by enslaving people, not hesitating to kill anyone who would get in his way.  A few years later, he confronted three other Gaian mutants, Howatzer, Vapido and Gedan, who freed his slaves and forced him to flee.
<p>
Margor destroyed the psychods that his father had left him so that nobody else would be able to use them.
</em>
<p>
At the end of the interview, Margor kills the psychologist.
