Still on Norvo, Rhodan and his team determine that Pauper, the second world of Dusty Queen, was where the Dolans were designed.  The experiment went wrong and created these gigantic monsters.  Rhodan receives an invitation from Chappuy Kitos, a Green Beast who is the leader of the Pelewons, the main race of the Beasts, who live on Pauper.
<p>
Rhodan lands on Pauper with a Terran delegation but the Beast makes them prisoner for fear that they would cooperate with the Power of the Center, and threatens to destroy the Krest by manipulating Dusty Queen, which is now the source of increasingly powerful eruptions.  Seeing that the threat is real, Rhodan offers to disclose the location of Monol in exchange for their lives.
<p>
Meanwhile, Ras Tschubai discovers the Skovarto in a cell and sets him free.  With his assistance, he finds the station responsible for manipulating the sun and he manages to destroy it.  The ensuing shockwave destroys the blister and the proto-algae that surround the planet start invading it.
