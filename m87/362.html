On Kliban, Scanlon Ocachee dies and his body is put in a coffin.  Before it takes off, Beriot -- his mind more and more affected by the recent events -- takes his place in the coffin, which soon takes the direction of Monol.  On the planet, his body is mistaken for that of an Okefenokee and the process of recovery is applied to him.  He is rejuvenated and his body is entirely restored.
<p>
Pucky notices his mental pattern and rescues him from the installations that had finally its mistake and was now trying to kill him.  On their way out, they meet with a regenerated Okefenokee, who they believe to be one of the Builders of the Center.  A phenomenon appears in the sky and a group of several dozens of restored Okefenokees disappear through what seems to be a teleporter.
