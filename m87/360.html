As Perry Rhodan celebrates his five-hundredth birthday, he explains that he doesn't intend to use the kalups brought by the rescue team to return to the Milky Way right now.  He wants to contact the Power of the Center and make sure that they won't become a threat to the human race in the future.
<p>
Documents gathered from the Super Engineer Agen Thrumb reveal the existence of a race called the Okefenokees, also called "philosophers", who seem to have an important role in the galaxy.  Rhodan sends the corvette KC-31 to their homeworld, located close to the center of M-87.
<p>
The KC-31 reaches the sun Scintilla and lands on the second planet.  The Okefenokees turn out to be the gnome-like teleporters that almost destroyed the Crest IV when it arrived in M-87.  They ask the Terrans to explain their intentions and Perry Rhodan and Roi Danton spend several hours telling their story.
<p>
Not only do the philosophers not believe them, but they accuse the Terrans to be emitting strong impulses meant to guide the Beasts to the Okefenokee homeworld.  The Halutians discover an emitter planted on the Crest by the Moogh Argtz when he was on board.  Soon, the Beast fleet starts attacking the Scintilla system and sever the teleportation network that connects the two planets.  The Crest IV and the Posbi ship intervene and they manage to destroy the opponents.  The Okfenokees eventually recognize the good will of the Terrans and accept to cooperate with them.
