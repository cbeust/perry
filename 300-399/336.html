The Khrest IV discovers a planet that seems to host suitable animals to replenish its meat supplies.  As the slaughtering begins, a strange phenomenon manifests itself:  an energy field appears where the beasts were killed, burning everything in the surroundings.
<p>
A scientist on board the Khrest IV realizes that he is the cause of this phenomenon:  some latent mutant abilities in his brain kicked in and in conjunction with the saprogenic bacteries in the planet's atmosphere, they create this field that threatens not only the crew but the whole spaceships.
<p>
He tries to isolate himself from everybody and eventually commits suicide, unable to bear the thought that he might endanger everyone on the Khrest.
