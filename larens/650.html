On December 28th, 3458, the whole Sol system is suddenly isolated from
the rest of the universe. An unpassable hyperdimensional veil covers all
the system and prevents anyone inside from communicating to the outside.
The ships can no longer travel to distant systems and linear travel is
unoperative, while inside communications are undisturbed. Perry Rhodan
makes a short intervention on the TV to sum up the situation and confesses
the scientists think a greater power is currently making them a demonstration.

<P>Alaska Saedalaere, the alien with a Cappin implant in his face, is joining
Imperium Alpha, where all the mutants have been called back. He is startled
to find an extraterrestrian in his room, who introduces himself as Calloberian,
a Xysrapen.

<P>Calloberian pretends he, and all those of his race, is able to see the
stars, even though nobody in the Sol system can. He pretends he can switch
between the dimensions, thanks to a special organ, not unlike the Laurins
flexorgan. As the scientists are trying to figure out how he can achieve
this, on the 5th of January, the stars appear again. Shortly after, a mysterious
spheric ship suddenly materializes&nbsp; in orbit around the Earth. At
first, the ship doesn't seem to be willing to land and keeps orbitting the Earth.

<P>Rhodan finally makes contact with the unknown ship. It is piloted by
Hotrenor-Taak, a Laren, who seems to know Perry Rhodan and the human race
fairly well. The Larens come from the NGC 3190 galaxy, 21 million light-years
away from Sol. He is the representative of the Council (or Hetos) of the
Seven, which gathers seven galaxies. The Council wants the Milky Way to
join them, with Perry Rhodan as the First Hetran. When Rhodan replies that
he doubts that all the peoples in the Milky Way would accept this nomination,
Hotrenor-Taak says the Council supports First Hetrans with all their power if
need be.

<P>In order to impress the Terrans, Hotrenor-Taak asks them to test his
energy shield. It quickly turns out that none of the Terran weapons can
shake the energy shield of his ship. After the first blasts, the initially
500 meter wide round ship swells to reach 5000 meters and takes a yellowish,
bright hue. The energy shield seems to be made of pure energy, which leads
the Terran scientists to coin the term "Energy cell shield", EC-Shield
<I>[Struktur-Variablen-Energiezellen Raumer or SVE Raumer. I am at a loss
translating accurately this term... --Cedric]</I>

<P>Shocked, Rhodan decides to allow the Laren to land in Terrania. He will
pretend he accepts to enter the Hetos of the Seven until he learns more
about this EC-Shield, and also on the other races involved in the Council.

<P>The Laren ship lands and Hotrenor-Taak appears before the Terrans for
the first time. He says the Council is currently holding a meeting in their
galaxy, and invites Rhodan to join them there in order to be introduced
to the other six members. Pressed by the Terranian TV, broadcasting the
event galaxy-wide, Rhodan is urged to answer immediately. He turns the
offer down, saying that nobody in the Council ever considered asking him
his opinion.

<P>Hotrenor-Taak is very surprised and retires to think the matter further.
Meanwhile, reactions from the various peoples in the Milky Way start to
arrive to Terrania, and they are essentially in favor of the nomination
of Rhodan as the First Hetran. Rhodan still can't resign himself to it.
He eventually agrees to go to Hotrenor-Taak's home galaxy, but accompanied.

<P>He informs Hotrenor-Taak he wants to travel on board of one of his corvettes,
inside the Laren's ship. He also gives him a list of people that will join
him, among which Icho Tolot, Alaska Saedalaere, Gucky and Calloberian.
Hotrenor-Taak is not surprised by all the names he reads, except for Calloberian,
whom he admits he does not know. Rhodan explains that the Xisrapen is able
to see the stars despite the protection field the Larens used recently
over the Sol system. Hotrenor-Taak accepts Rhodan's conditions.

<P>The MC8 corvette is brought into the Laren ship, which then takes off.
Shortly after, Hotrenor-Taak comes to see his guests and invites them to
visit the ship. He also informs them that the meeting will not take place
in the NGC-3190 galaxy, as initially planned, but in the void between the
galaxies, on the planet Hetossa, second planet a seven-planet system, revolving
around the Hartzon star. This unexpected change makes the Terrans more
suspicious about the Laren's intentions.

<P>Shortly before they land on Hetossa, a Laren named Muskenor-Aart joins
them on board and informs them about the planet, which capital is called
Mivtrav. Hotrenor-Taak tells Rhodan that for now, he will only deal with
the Larens and will not get to meet the other members of the Council. Furthermore,
the discussion makes Rhodan think that the Larens might be aware of Rhodan's
recent interactions with IT and Anti-IT. Questioned about this, Hotrenor-Taak
admits he knows about these facts but won't say more.

<P>Hotrenor-Taak then alludes to the fact that Rhodan would have to disarm
all the Solar Fleet, along with all the armed forces of the other races,
in order for the Milky Way to join the Council. Rhodan is shocked by this
demand but remains imperturbable, as Hotrenor-Taak seems to be confident
that he will answer positively.

<P>The Terrans are brought to their apartments. Fearing for their safety
if he refused the Laren's offer, Rhodan decides to pretend he will accept
all their demands. He sends the teleporters in reconnaissance, hoping to
learn more about the city before the conference begins.

<P>After a few teleportations, Gucky and Tschubai discover a raging fight
opposing two Laren armies. Forces coming from the capital are surrounding
a group of Larens fighting for their lives. Gucky teleports back to the
city and brings Rhodan back on the battlefield. They kidnap one of the
soldiers and question him. Before he dies, the Laren says he's part of
a resistance movement. They wanted to take advantage of the arrival of
the Terrans to make a demonstration to the Council. He says the Council
are merciless beasts that enslave people. He asks Rhodan to rescue Roctin-Par,
their leader, who is about to be captured. Should this happen, there would
be nobody left to question the authority of the Council.

<P>The teleporters eventually locate the rebels base and are able to rescue
Roctin-Par before the Larens take over. Unfortunately, Calloberian dies
during the battle. Roctin-Par is brought back to the Terrans apartments
and explains Rhodan that they're opposing the dictatorial ruling of the
Larens. Questioned about the exact motivations of the rebels, Roctin-Par
refuses to answer.

<P>On the Earth, the other Xisrapens realize that Calloberian might be
dead, since they are no longer in mental contact with her (Calloberian
actually turns out to be a female). However, she might also be simply pretending,
they can't tell.

<P>Meanwhile, on Hetossa, Rhodan prepares to meet the Council.
