  <font face="Arial" size="2">I hope I'm not teaching grandmother to suck eggs 
  here &lt;smile&gt; but I thougt I'd post some things I have discovered (usually by 
  accident) concerning out translating hobby.&nbsp; many of the folk here seem to 
  have bought and attempt to translate the actual novels.&nbsp; I'm not in that 
  position sadly - I used to have over 1200 of the german editions but they were 
  destroyed in a fire at the storage utility I used.&nbsp; </font>
</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;</div>
<div>
  <font face="Arial" size="2">I have used personal translating packages such as 
  Power Translator and Universal Translator, but while they have the advantages 
  ofhaving personal modifiable dictionaries I find the on-line versions much 
  faster and easier (provided the sourse text is modified slightly first).</font></div>
<div>
  &nbsp;</div>
<div>
  <font face="Arial" size="2">Everyone knows about and has had agood laugh with 
  Babelfish (<a href="http://world.altavista.com/sites/gben/pos/babelfish/trns">http://world.altavista.com/sites/gben/pos/babelfish/trns</a>) 
  but SysTrans&nbsp;have improved the engine significantly&nbsp;and its works pretty well 
  for german and French.&nbsp; My prefered option is Prompt Reverso's engine 
  available at <a href="http://translation2.paralink.com/">
  http://translation2.paralink.com/</a> and
  <a href="http://www.translate.ru/eng/">http://www.translate.ru/eng/</a>&nbsp;as 
  they handle source of any length whereas babelfish bows aout after a few 
  hundered words.&nbsp; Both these options allow you to either enter text or a URL to 
  a page and then allow subsequent following o flinks, but in my experience it 
  proves more reliable to right click the link and open in a new browser wndow 
  .&nbsp; Another great engine, but one which does not allow link-following is
  <a href="http://www.freetranslation.com/web.htm">
  http://www.freetranslation.com/web.htm</a>.&nbsp; This can provide a very and 
  reliable translation.&nbsp; I usually have open the dictionary at
  <a href="http://translator.dictionary.com/text.html">
  http://translator.dictionary.com/text.html</a>&nbsp;which seems extensive and I ind 
  useful for those single words or compound nouns the engines couldn't cope 
  with.&nbsp; I tend to hit a translation with two engines and arrange have the 
  windows open side by side and block copy the sentence from eith that makes the 
  most obvious sense.</font></div>
<div>
  &nbsp;</div>
<div>
  <font face="Arial" size="2">Which brings me nicely to summaries.&nbsp; </font>
</div>
<div>
  <font face="Arial" size="2">ENGLISH: Cedric's page you all must know is at
  <a href="http://www.beust.com/cedric/perry">http://www.beust.com/cedric/perry</a>&nbsp;and 
  has summaries of varying length from novels&nbsp;200 - 299, 300 - 370 or so, 
  (current in France), the 650 - 700, 700 - 800, and 800 to about 810 which he 
  is updating as he reads.&nbsp;&nbsp; He also has 1900 - 1999 and 2000 - 2029 last time I 
  looked. My site will have 100 - 149, 150 - 200, 1400 - 1499 (eventually 
  extending through to 1799 as I have full machine translations of all books 
  higher than 1428).&nbsp; I may continue the Tolkander (1800 - 1875) cycle of 
  Thoregon but that depends on my role in the fan translation effort.</font></div>
<div>
  <font face="Arial" size="2">FRENCH: There are great cycle summaries at
  <a href="http://www.ensg.ign.fr/Pages_Perso/Pages_de_J_Y_PRIOU/PR_Cycles_VO/PR_CyclesVO.html">
  http://www.ensg.ign.fr/Pages_Perso/Pages_de_J_Y_PRIOU/PR_Cycles_VO/PR_CyclesVO.html</a>&nbsp;as 
  well as an alomost complete book by book account o fthe French 
  series&nbsp;(currently up to 300, for example his individual summaries for the 
  Second empire (150 - 199 in German) are at
  <a href="http://www.ensg.ign.fr/Pages_Perso/Pages_de_J_Y_PRIOU/PR_Cycles_FR/PR_CycleFR_IV.html">
  http://www.ensg.ign.fr/Pages_Perso/Pages_de_J_Y_PRIOU/PR_Cycles_FR/PR_CycleFR_IV.html</a>.&nbsp; 
  He has also thoughfully added summaries of the edition the french publishes 
  did not translate (like the several Ace did not at first), so careful with 
  tose links.&nbsp; Another key site is
  <a href="http://membres.lycos.fr/jeddak/cadrerho.htm">
  http://membres.lycos.fr/jeddak/cadrerho.htm</a>&nbsp;who also has summaries (resumees) 
  for th efirst 100 and from 300 to French current), and from 2100 to current in 
  Germany.&nbsp; His method though is tricky for us machine translators, he ha 
  disabled right-click copy, which remains intact even after the translation 
  engine has done its job.&nbsp; No fear, save the translate page as a html doc and 
  open with a web editor like FrontPage, or a word processor.&nbsp; Alternatively 
  save as text.</font></div>

  <font face="Arial" size="2">GERMANY: A little wheat and plenty of chaff about 
  here.&nbsp; The wheat is mainly at <a href="http://www.prchronik.net">
  http://www.prchronik.net</a>, part of the might proc.org fan organisation that 
  powers Dorgon.&nbsp; Thomas Rabenstein has very very detaile summaires from 1900 - 
  to current, as well as very detailed cycle summaries which actually breal down 
  into a blow by blow account of the hefte.&nbsp; The on-line magazine but to avoid 
  ploughing though and finding the reviews in the individual editions of the 
  magazine, point the web translator&nbsp;here
  <a href="http://www.flash-zine.de/allgem/pr_list.htm">
  http://www.flash-zine.de/allgem/pr_list.htm</a>.&nbsp; Another good source (pun 
  intended) is the matter source at <a href="http://www.materiequelle.de">
  http://www.materiequell e.de</a>, he has summries from the 1 - 55 and 1428 up 
  (some are not linked but can be accessedby adjust the number in the address 
  bar.&nbsp; Good detail in the cycle summaries and lexicon as these are derived from 
  the official books published in germany.&nbsp; Summaries of varying length and 
  detail for scratchy sections o fthe series are also at
