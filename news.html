After a long hiatus, I'm resuming my reading of the Cantaros cycle,
currently at 1430. I also fixed and improved some of the PHP code
that powers this site.

I completely redesigned this Web site with PHP and MySQL.  All the summaries
are now safely stored in a database and it is possible for users to upload
their own summaries.

Two weeks ago, I finished reading Heft #1150, which represents the 500th Heft I 
read since the beginning, #650. I started reading #650 in July 1999, almost 
exactly five years ago, so my average so far is about one hundred Hefte per 
year. Interestingly, I just finished reading Heft #1159 which tells the entire 
story of Seth Apophis, the mysterious super-intelligence that Perry Rhodah has 
been fighting since the beginning of the Cosmic Hanse cycle. If you are 
interested, Seth Apophis' story can be found here:  <a href="http://beust.com/cedric/perry/endless-armada/1158.html">
Part 1</a> and <a href="http://beust.com/cedric/perry/endless-armada/1159.html">
Part 2</a>.
 <p>

What is lying ahead for Perry Rhodan in this cycle? (warning, small spoilers 
below)
<p> 
Perry is still trying to find the heart of the Armada and its mysterious 
commander, Ordoban. He will need to accomplish the predictions of the Prophet of 
the Armada: take control of the Endless Armada and drive it through the Milky 
Way. The Galactic Fleet is also under fire from Seth Apophis' forces, since the 
super-intelligence finally woke up from the shock that the penetration of the 
Frost Ruby caused her. But before all, he will need to defeat the Armadasmiths, 
the so-called Sons of Ordoban, who are determined to kill Ordoban and take over 
the Endless Armada.
<p> 
So much to do...
 <p>
Onward with the cycle!

<p>I am happy to report that I am celebrating my 200th Heft read in German.<br>

<br>
About four years ago, I started reading my first Heft in German.&nbsp; It was 
#650,
<a href="http://beust.com/cedric/perry/larens/650.html">&quot;Der Bund der Sieben&quot;</a>, 
which debuted the cycle of the Larens.&nbsp; Back then, I didn't seriously think 
that I would last very long:&nbsp; my knowledge of German was cursory and it 
took me several hours to read an entire Heft.&nbsp; A few weeks later, it 
occurred to me that I could scan the Hefte and run a software translator on 
them.&nbsp; Granted, the output text was laughable, but suddenly, my reading 
time dropped to a couple of hours for each Heft, including the scan.</span></p>
<p>Here we are, four years later.&nbsp; The whole 
process now takes less than one hour, I have an extensive dictionary of 
corrections that fix most of the translation mistakes my software translator 
makes.&nbsp; The output is much more readable and I still enjoy it just as much</p>

<p>Why am I writing all this?</p>
<p>Because I just finished a key Heft in the current 
cycle:&nbsp; #850, <a href="http://beust.com/cedric/perry/bardioc/850.html">
&quot;Bardioc&quot;</a>, thus celebrating my 200th Heft read (actually, it's more than 
that since I read a part of the Materia and Solar Residence cycle, but let's not 
nitpick).</p>
<p>As all the key Hefte, this one doesn't disappoint.&nbsp; 
It's actually made of two parts and tells in great details the origin of 
Bardioc, thereby explaining some of the mysteries that have surrounded the past 
fifty Hefte but also creating more questions that will be answered in the 
upcoming cycles.</p>
<p>I won't disclose anything about this cycle in an 
attempt not to expose you to spoilers.&nbsp; Note that I am actually at #855 
now, so if you want to do some catch up on the cycle, I suggest you start from 
the main <a href="http://beust.com/cedric/perry/bardioc">Bardioc summary page</a>.</p>

Well, there goes another cycle. I just finished reading Heft #799, thus 
completing the Aphilie cycle. It's not been funny all the way through, and there 
were definitely a few lows during this long cycle, but I'm glad I persisted, 
because it definitely picked up in the last quarter. It took me about eighteen 
months to complete the whole cycle, including a five-month interruption. I am 
now headed for the Bardioc cycle, and I can't wait to start #800, appropriately 
titled &quot;The Empress of Therm&quot;.

Today is an important date: I just posted the summary to Hefte #750 and #751 on 
my Web site. Why is it important? Because the first German Perry Rhodan I ever 
read was #650.
<p>
Almost exactly two years ago, I posted my first summary of a German Heft. It was 
#650, &quot;The Council of the Seven&quot;. I started learning German then, and I was 
pretty confident that this madness would fade and that it would be a matter of 
months before I found the task of painfully reading through every word too 
tedious.
<p>
Well, I was wrong.
<p>
While I did realize that learning German was too hard considering the little 
time I have for my hobbies, I found unexpected allies in a scanning software and 
a translation program. Suddenly, reading a Heft took only a few hours, as 
opposed to about twenty when I was reading them on my own. Suddenly, it occurred 
to me that after all, the task might actually be feasible. Still, I was pretty 
sure that I was just putting off the inevitable. That soon, I would give up.

<p>
Then again, I was wrong.
<p>
For the past two years, I have been reading three cycle simultaneously, and while there 
were definitely some lows during this period, I hang on and I'm still hooked.
<p>
So, what happened exactly during these past two years?
<p>
I kept reading the French publication, which was in the middle of the Masters of 
the Island back then and is now one third into M-87.
<p>
I read 100 Hefte from the Larens/Aphilie cycle. There was an undisputable pause 
in the middle of the Aphilie, when I lost close to all my interest for the 
cycle. But it eventually passed.
<p>
Also, I read approximately 80 Hefte from the current cycle, starting from #1950. 
Why only 80? Because around #2030, I decided I wasn't hooked enough on the new 
cycle to warrant three simultaneous readings. So I decided to put it on hold and 
focus on the Aphilie and M-87. However, I'm still receiving those and I will 
probably resume reading them when they reach #2099, in a few months from now.
<p>
What are my resolutions for the future?
<p>
Hopefully, keep reading the Aphilie cycle and try to maintain the pace of once a 
week. I could read faster, but I want to save some of my reading time for 
non-Perry books.
<p>

In December, I will resume my subscription to GPL as it will hit Hefte #1001 and 
on, in an attempt to complete my collection which stops at 1000.
<p>
And hopefully, the French edition will have accelerated its publication pace 
(currently at ten per year) and I will work slowly my way up until I catch up 
with #650...
<p>
Happy anniversary!
<p>
