The Earth, the Moon and Medallion emerge in an unknown region of space.  This area is controlled by an incarnation called Clermac, which takes notice of the materialization of a solar system and starts monitoring it.
<p>
<p>
The arrival of the Earth has been observed by Douc Langur.  Langur is a scientist on an exploration mission.  He reports to an entity called the Empress of Therm and is guided by a portable computer called Logikor.  Langur was initially part of a bigger space station called Module which disappeared.  Langur is now stranded and when the solar system materializes in front of him, he decides to explore the Earth.
<p>
Alaska begins to realize that he seems to be the only person on Earth.  He decides to head for Terrania.
