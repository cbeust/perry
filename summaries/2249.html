<p>
 In the battle with STROWWAN'S fleet, which involves extremely 
      heavy losses for both sides, the decision comes down in favor of the 
      Protectors, due to the unexpectedly intervention of thousands of 
      bionic cruisers and two Nocturnan obelisks that ES called for help 
      from the galaxy Laxaron (aka Fornax), after some ships equipped with
      Paratechnology by STROWWAN had even succeeded tearing the artificial 
      world Wanderer from its travels in hyperspace.<
<p>
      The price of the 
      victory is high though, as the armed forces of the Protectors come 
      from the conflict heavily worn down. Indeed, the opposing units 
      flee, but are still dangerous for the main worlds of the Protectors. 
      Therefore, the strongly damaged Nocturnan obelisk Antallin teleports 
      to Tan-Jamondi II, while the obelisk Satrugar proceeds to Parrakh. 
      Antallin deviates from its course and falls on the planet Baikhal 
      Cain, where it dies. It sinks into the planetary crust, and its 
      substance foams and mixes with the planetary matter  whereby the 
      Holy Mountain originates. A strong Psi-component frees itself from 
      the mountain and disappears into space. From it later develops 
      Autonomous Gray.&nbsp; 
<p>
 The Nocturnan obelisk Satrugar falls on Parrakh very close to 
      the Protectors cathedral. An inland sea develops in which only the 
      cathedral itself, a piece of the Nocturnan obelisk and six volcanic 
      cones jut out. Satrugar goes mad after the fall. Gon-Orbhon tries to 
      help him, merging with the obelisk and thereby changes into an evil 
      being who thinks itself god. Decades later STROWWAN is finally 
      defeated by ES. The thickness concentration of the superintelligence 
      prospers, but the Protectors go downhill. The Ancient Trummstam is affected by it: the tree dies. The Paragon Cross then disappears, so 
      no more new Protectors can be consecrated. Gon-Orbhon takes over 
      power in Amringhar. The cathedral there becomes the core of his 
      empire and is called since then the Bulwark of Parrakh. In the fight
      against the Orbhon Empire, which is about to overrun Ammandul, Tagg 
      Kharzani's Kyber people are destined to play a determining role.
<p>
      Their mightiest weapons are the Kybb-Titans. These sixteen to 
            seventeen kilometer thick, misshapen spheres remind one of a living 
            being in some strange way. Their inside is filled by Nano-Cyborgs 
            (Technites) which can create everything that is required by the 
            Titans. Something mysterious proceeds within the Kybb-Titans; even 
            Tagg Kharzani does not know everything about it. The origin of the 
            Kybb-Titans likewise remains unknown. In areas that nobody can enter 
            the Moto-clones are developing, but nobody knows anything about 
            them.&nbsp; 
<p>
 Gon-Orbhon taps the sun Talan or its 6D-component with a jet ray 
  and begins the mental influencing of whole races in Ammandul. Soon 
  afterwards he sends naval contingents into the galaxy - once again 
  war breaks out. A thrust by the Protectors to Parrakh fails. Then ES 
  intervenes and seals all sixteen star clusters that belong to the
  sphere of influence of the Protectors and the Orbhon Empire in 
  Ammandul, Amringhar and Kyranghar in hypercocoons. After that, the 
  star clusters have no more contact with each other or the remaining 
  universe. The war is thereby finished all of a sudden and ES can 
  continue to build up his thickness concentration in peace. Peace 
  also rules at first in Jamondi. The few remaining Protectors bring 
  the project DISTANCE TRACK to life. They want to try to create a 
  connection between Jamondi and Arphonie. By chance it is found out 
  that everywhere in Jamondi naval federations of the Kybb are being 
  deployed. Tagg Kharzani is behind it: He wants to rip rule over the 
  star ocean to himself. After heavy fighting, the Protectors pull 
  together all their remaining forces at Barinx, in the &quot; Ring of Nine 
  Suns &quot;. There they are hit devastatingly - all the Protectors fall, 
  after Gimgon professes his feelings for Lyressea. The Sentries are 
  evacuated in time and hidden on different planets. They are 
  paramount to the eventual revival of the Order of Protectors. The 
  Kybb-Titans apparently destroy Barinx and the whole nine suns <
  system &nbsp;
<p>
      Lyresseas report ends with that. At the same time the first 
      participants of the Convention of the Majesties arrive on Tom 
      Karthay.&nbsp; <br>
