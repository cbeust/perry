The 
Terrans are now the masters of Androbeta. But on Androalpha, the Maahks are 
getting more active. Grek-1 suggests that he should go spying on Androcenter, 
the main planet of the Maahks. There, he learns that the Masters of the Island 
asked the Maahks to check out all chain of transmitters that give access to 
Andromeda. Grek-1 is eventually spotted as a spy, but before being killed, he 
creates a rebellion among the Maahks, some of them willing to be freed from the 
reign of the Masters of the Island.
