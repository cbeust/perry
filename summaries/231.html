December 2401. 
Grek-1, now among the Terran ranks, tells Rhodan about a solar system halfway 
between the Milky Way and Andromeda, the Lost System, where a transmitter can be 
found, which is connected to that of the Sextuple system. This system had only 
one planet, Kulloch, populated by Maahks, but the Masters of the Island blew the 
planet a thousand years ago because the Maahks had rebelled against them. The 
system is now therefore desert. Rhodan goes there with the Khrest II and finds 
out that some Maahks survived the destruction of the planet and live among its 
debris. They are very aggressive toward Rhodan because they think the Masters of 
the Island are back, and they prevent the Terrans from reaching the transmitter, 
located on one of the debris.
