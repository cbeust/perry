After its failure in 
the Twin system, the fortress flies through the transmitters and arrives in the 
Sextuple system. It then proceeds to attack Kahalo. To destroy it once for all, 
Rhodan sends teleporter mutants inside the gigantic ship, where they leave a 
gigabomb. The operation is a success and the fortress is destroyed, but the 
mutants can't make it back to a Terran ship and are strayed in space.
