Meanwhile, in Androalpha, the 
rebellion sparked by Grek-1 is gaining in strength. The Maahks rebels have 
defeated those obeying the Masters of the Island, and are now about to attack 
Andromeda. A mosquito departs from KA-Supertarif, now a solar base, to inform 
Rhodan of the latest events, but it is spotted and shot down by the Tefrodians. 
It is marooned on a planet that looks desert at first sight. Further 
investigation reveals that the planet holds subterranean factories where the 
Tedroders create very little spheric devices. The Tefrodians locate the escaped 
crew and try to capture them, but the Khrest III rescues them.
