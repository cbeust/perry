On the Khrest III, the mutants detect the telepathetic 
beacons left by the Khrest III. The men of the Khrest III find the cargo ship 
and fit the new kalups. But the Dino pod is nowhere to be found. After fruitless 
searches, the men of the Dino-3 are definitely considered as missing [Cedric: 
actually, they are not dead and will play a key role in a future cycle, but 
their whereabouts won't be explained in this cycle]. 
<P>With its brand new engines, the Khrest III crosses the intergalactic chasm 
and joins Andromeda. On its way, it discovers giant platforms, built by the 
Maahks. These stations are used as relays by the fleeing Maahk fleet. The 
Terrans are witnessing how the initially Andromedan Maahks were chased by the 
arrival of the Lemurs, and how they fleed toward the Milky Way where, 30,000 
years later, they will confront the Arkonids.
