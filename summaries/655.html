Hotrenor-Taak informs Rhodan that Atlan must be chased with all the Terran
forces in order to be tried and judged for the edification of the inhabitants of the
Milky Way. Before Rhodan can even react, the Larens capture Atlan near the
Vega system and his trial is quickly scheduled.

<P>

Rhodan comes up with a hopeless plan involving a Kayndell, a
cosmopsychologist and Goronkon, a magician, former specialist of impossible
escape tricks. The first phase of this plan consists in stealing Atlan's
cell activator and replacing it with a fake. Rhodan and the magician are
successful in their attempt and the deadly countdown then starts for the
unsuspecting Atlan, who only has 62 hours left to live.

<P>

The trial starts and not surprisingly, Atlan is found guilty and charged with all possible
espionnage deeds and sentenced to death. Then Rhodan speaks and to the
general bewilderment, asks Hotrenor-Taak if he can execute the sentence
himself. The Laren agrees and then, on Rhodan's demand, hands the
Administrator his gun. Rhodan enters the cell and aims at Atlan's chest,
destroying the pseudo-activator. Atlan is severeley injured in the process
but remains alive. Rhodan then explains that the sentence he decided would
be for the Arkonid to slowly decay to death. Rhodan becomes the most hated
person throughout the Galaxy.

<P>

A few hours later, he goes to see Hotrenor-Taak and tells him he estimates
the Terrans have had their share of shock. Atlan should at least be
decently buried. He convinces the Laren to bury the Arkonid in a cemetery he
chose. A clever arrangement of
mirrors is supposed to make Atlan's body immediately replaced with a dummy,
while he will be transfered to a safe place where his cell activator awaits
him.

<P>

Although suspicious, Hotrenor-Taak agrees and using a diversion caused by
the Terrans, Goronkon successfully substitutes Atlan's body with the dummy.
Atlan, who was on the verge of death, realizes that Perry never let him
down and understands the risks he took to save him.
