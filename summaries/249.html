December 2402. 
Thanks to Grek-1's sacrifice, Rhodan can let Bell know about the imminent 
arrival of the Maahks in the Lost System. Bell can resist several attacks, and 
the Terrans finally block the transmitter so that only them can use it. The 
chain of the transmitters is under complete Terran control : the Masters of the 
Islands are now besieged in their own galaxy.
