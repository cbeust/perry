In January 2402, one year after 
the conquest of Androbeta, Rhodan decides to venture into Androbeta with his new 
ship, the Khrest III. This ultracruiser is 2.5km wide and fit with the famous SH 
shield [Cedric: I don't know the original name for this one, I'll just leave the 
initials], identical to the ones used by the Maahks. The Khrest III can go as 
far as 1,2 million light years, and is therefore able to cross the intergalactic 
void. While approaching Andromeda, Rhodan discovers a huge space station the 
size of a big city. The exploration of this station causes the awakening of 
Kalak, the only inhabitant of the city. Kalak is a Paddler. A long time ago, 
these galactic engineers were building space stations that were used as stellar 
stations. But one day, the Masters of the Island decided the Paddlers were 
becoming too powerful and had the stations attacked by one of their enslaved 
races. Kalak's starbase (KA-Supertarif) barely escaped from destruction, but 
only Kalak survived. He plunged himself into an artificial sleep, waiting for 
better days. He is ready to offer the services of his station to the Terrans if 
they accept to help him find other Paddlers.
