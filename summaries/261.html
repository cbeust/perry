The Terrans realize that the Tefrodian transmitter actually 
sent them within the forbidden area. As the Khrest III is hiding near a 
planetary system, the Terrans discover a strange planet, inhabited by immortal 
humans that were kidnapped throughout different eras on the Earth. These 
Terrans, completely apathetic, seem to have lost all notions of time. Some have 
been living on this planet -- called History -- for centuries. This human zoo is 
guarded by Tefrodians who are all alike.
