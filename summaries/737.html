On Olymp, Anson Argyris is still leading the resistance against the Larens.  Recently, the Larens withdrew all their fleet from the system, hardly leaving any protection on the planet.  The Vario-Robot decides to investigate.  As clues lead him toward the NUG fuel reserve, he receives a old but valid identification code from a spaceship.
<p>
When the SZ-2 enters the system of Olymp, Atlan is puzzled to discover that no Larens can be detected.  A trap has indeed been laid out by Hotrenor-Taak on Olymp, who always suspected that Rhodan would return to the Milky Way.  This could only happen with an interstellar ship using NU-Gas.  Therefore, he blockaded two of the main NU-Gas factories and left Olymp unguarded, hoping to lure Rhodan into a trap.  Of course, he doesn't know that Rhodan is not on board the SZ-2.
<p>
On Olymp, Argyris understands that the Larens are trying to trap the spaceship and decides to act.  The SZ-2 starts loading up gas and just as the Larens are about to intervene, Argyris detonates a bomb in the plant.  Using the ensuing chaos, the SZ-2 takes off safely.  Its tanks are not full, but it's got enough gas to keep flying for a while.
