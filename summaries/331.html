<p>
On the Earth, a civil war is getting more and more likely, as a prophet called Croton Manor is urging the Terrans to take action against the impostor.  Manor is a mutant who has correctly read through Anrath and who thinks that the impostor is acting against the Terrans.
<p>
Bull manages to talk to him and he finally understands that Anrath is working for the good of mankind.  As Manor is about to make a public declaration urging his followers to listen to Rhodan, he is kidnapped by Grichert, who hopes to put the blame on the government.  The solar defense finally frees him.  On TV, he publicly announces his support for Rhodan but he is killed shortly thereafter by a man working for Grichert.
