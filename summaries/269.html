When 
informed of the situation, Bell decides to dispatch a commando to help Rhodan. 
This commando is made of the Woolvers, Tako Kakuta and Lemy Danger. Using a 
trick, the Terrans bring the Maahks to attack Vario, and use the confusion to 
send the commando into the past. Thanks to the mutants, the commando 
successfully escapes the Lemurs on Kahalo. As Lemy Danger joins the Khrest III, 
Tako and the twins teleport on Kahalo to try to capture Frasbur again.
