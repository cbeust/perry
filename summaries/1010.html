Back on Earth, the analysis of the posiphages is given to a scientist named Marcel Boulmeester, helped by his assistant Adelaie.  The first attempt at creating a counter-virus, called police cells, fails and the scientists quickly start working on the second generation.  However, several police cells have had the opportunity to escape and they cause an explosion in the lab, allowing several posiphages to escape.
<p>
Quiupu, who is also working on the problem, manages to steal samples of the second generation of police cells and starts experimenting on his own.
<p>
The escaped cells infect Boulmeester, who realized that the posiphages are able to thrive on organic cells as well.  By the time he realizes his mistake, it's too late and the posiphages have started transforming him into a semi-positronic entity that calls itself "the Fifth Messenger".  Adelaies has also been infected by a few cells and Marcel convinces her to head for the Moon, where he intends to infect Nathan.
