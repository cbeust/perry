In order to 
warn the Prometheus III, on its way to Horror, so that it is not struck by the 
reduction beam, Rhodan sets up an operation that must go back into the second 
planetary layer and bring back an escape pod that was abandoned there during 
their trip through the planet. The task is daunting, since the humans are only 
2mm tall, but they successfully pilot the ship back to the surface.
