Atlan suggests to use two new 
mutants, the brothers Rakar and Tronar Woolver. These two brothers come from 
Chrystal. They are linked by a very strong telepathetic connection and are able 
to teleport by following the energy fields between any two points in space. 
Using a stratagem, Rhodan causes the traitors to call by radio the Maahk ship. 
The two &quot;wave runners&quot; take advantage of the communication to teleport 
onto the Maahk ship. There, they find out about the multiduplicator devices, but 
Tronar is captured by the Maahks, who pass him through the multiduplicator 
before killing him. Rakar is able to flee.
