October 2400. 
The Terrans keep on exploring the planets of the Twin system. On Chaos, they 
meet with the Drung, a strange atemporal being, which tells them the giant 
transmitters have been created by so-called Masters of the Island, a race that 
rules over the Andromeda galaxy. The Twins are both a relay to Andromeda, and a 
trap to capture anybody who tries to reach the galaxy. On planet Raum/Quinta, 
the Terrans finally find the main station that controls the transmitter, but it 
is guarded by an army of robots. While the Terrans are fighting them, a giant 
cylindric ship appears through the transmitter and destroys Box-8323. The 
terrans are able to conquer the station and point the transmitter on the 
Sextuple system. Then, the Khrest II fights the cylinder-shaped ship, destroys 
it and dives into the transmitter.
