To save Rhodan and the Khrest 
III, Bell manages to send into the past via the Vario transmitter a ship, the 
Dino-3, a giant cargo carrying three kalup engines. The end goal is to fit the 
Khrest III with these engines so that it can reach Andromeda without having to 
go though the transmitter, and from there, use the Vario transmitter to get back 
into the present. When the Dino-3 arrives into the past, the Khrest III is no 
longer there. The crew of the cargo ship understands that the Khrest III is five 
hundred years in the future. They abandon the Dino-3 near Redpoint, leaving 
telepathetic beacons in the nearby area, tuned on the mental frequences of the 
mutants, so that only they will be able to unlock the ship. 
<P>Then the men of the Dino-3 board on a pod and set on a five hundred 
light-year trip with a nearly relativistic speed. This way, only a few months 
will have elapsed for them during the actual five hundred years. They hope they 
will find the Khrest III at the end of their journey.
