The inner side of the 
second planetary layer, called &quot;green floor&quot; because of the greenish 
light that basks everything, is inhabited by two races : the Kangs and the 
Esquis, who are fighting mercilessly. The Kangs have parapsychic powers that 
neutralize atomic powered machines. The Terrans eventually pull through and 
escape from the Kangs.
