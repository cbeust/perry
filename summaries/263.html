A little later, while fleeing 
away from the galactic center, the Khrest III attends a fight between Maahks and 
Tefrodians. A strayed Tefrodian ship, the Susama, is then spotted. Kallak thinks 
it might contain multiduplicators, so Rhodan tries to capture it. It is actually 
a trap laid out by the Masters of the Island. The trap succeeds and the 
Tefrodians are able to retrieve the molecular imprints of Gucky, Andre Lenoir and 
Ichot Tolot. To prevent this, Rhodan follows the Susama, which tries to flee 
toward the galactic center.
