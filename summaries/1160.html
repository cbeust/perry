On its way to Loolandre, the Galactic Fleet detects the aura of Seth Apophis on a planet called Redworld.  A team lands on the planet and meets Harman, the messenger of Seth Apophis, who tells them that they will soon become slaves of the super-intelligence.  During the interaction, Seth Apophis manages to turn a member of the expedition into one of her agents.
<p>
The fleet resumes its course and is soon attacked by forces of the super-intelligence.  Most of the crew of the Base falls under Seth Apophis' influence except for the activator bearers and those that carry an Armada Flame.  The super-intelligence contacts Gesil and tells her that she will reveal everything about her origin if she accepts to betray Rhodan.  Gesil refuses.
<p>
Gesil asks the doctor to administer her a drug that will allow her to protect her thoughts and then devises a plan to reconquer the Base.  Unfortunately, the doctor was under Seth Apophis' control and the Base becomes prisoner of the super-intelligence.  The Terrans are taken to Aitheran, the center of Seth Apophis' kingdom.
