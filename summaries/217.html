February 2401. Using the the giant escape pod, the 
Terrans try to send a message to the Prometheus III, but the message is 
intercepted by the wheel-shaped fortress guarding Horror. The fortress captures 
the Khrest II and the Terrans discover that the inhabitants of the fortress are 
Maahks), a methan-breathing race that once populated the Milky Way. A merciless 
war opposed them to the Arkonids 10,00 <BR>years ago, which was won by the 
Arkonids, thanks to the Converte <BR>Guns <BR>(a gift to the Arkonids by IT). 
The new weapon tilted the war in favor of the Arkonids and nearly all the Maahks 
were exterminated in the galaxy. The survivors fled to Andromeda, and they now 
serve the Masters of the Island. 
<P>The flying fortress departs from Horror and flies through the Horror 
transmitter. Its intent is to attack the Terran fleet on the Twin system. During 
the transition, both the fortress and the Khrest come back to their normal sizes 
(250km for the fortress !). The Khrest II is able to escape from within the 
fortress and joins back Tifflor.
