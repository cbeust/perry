Since the Terrans 
have nothing to do while waiting for the Prometheus II, Rhodan decides to 
explore Horror's surface, despite Atlan's warning. The planet seems desert 
except for two big domes on both poles. As the Khrest II is approaching the 
ground, a beam from one of the domes hits them and the ship and its crew are 
miniaturized to 1/1000th of their size. The Khrest II is able to destroy th 
<BR>sout <BR>dome before landing, but is still under the influence of th 
<BR>other reduction field, generated by the south pole dome. 
<P>A wheel-shaped flying fortress, actually 250m wide, then attacks the Khrest 
II, which is forced to flee (it is only 1,5m large). The Khrest II evades the 
fortress but is then stuck on Horror, all the machines being out of order as a 
consequence of their miniaturization.
