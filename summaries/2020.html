Falo Gause is one of the best Terra football players. After a brilliant victory of his team, he is suddenly accused of being a mutant. Tests are conducted that reveal he possesses a variation of telekinetic skills appliable to football only. Since this discovery ends his career, he decides to create an organization that will strive to have  monochrome mutants accepted as normal citizens.
<p>
In order to raise funds, Gause organizes an exhibition where he will play his last match, despite Moharion Mawrey's opposition. The event is a complete success and raises enough money for a new organization of mutants to be created : the Mutant Ring.
