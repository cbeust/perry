Actually, the 
Masters of the Islands have decided to completely destroy Androbeta. Numerous 
suicide ships are sent against all the planets, where they crash and kill the 
population. Rhodan discovers that the pilots of these suicide ships are 
androids, but not from Andromeda. The robots are created on a lonely planet 
between Andromeda and Androbeta called Tenebria. The Terrans move to Tenebria 
but are repelled by missiles. A small commando manages to break through and 
reaches the surface of the planet.
