Hiding near Redpoint, 
a red giant in the galactic center, the Khrest III's crew has no clue as to how 
to rejoin the present. Rhodan sends the Woolver twins on a secret mission to 
capture Frasbur, one of the Masters of the Island, acting as a secret agent on 
Kahalo. The Woolvers attend a meeting between Frasbur and Regnal-Orton, another 
Master of the Island on an inspection visit. They learn that the Masters of the 
Island are humans and have cell activators. An attempt to capture Regnal-Orton 
fails, causing his death. Hiding in the ship of the Masters of the Island, the 
twins are brought back into the present, in Andromeda. There, they join Reginald 
Bell, on board of the supercruiser General Deringhouse who was patroling in the 
Vario area.
