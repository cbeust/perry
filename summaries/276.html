In the present, 
Mory Abro is worried about the whereabouts of her husband. She has the idea to 
consult the Barkonids. Since Barkon left the Milky Way thousands of years ago, 
its inhabitants might have kept information on the state of the Galaxy at the 
time where Rhodan is. With Bell's help, she prepares an expedition to find 
Barkonis, still wandering between the two galaxies. The expedition first meets 
with Luxids [Cedric: which Rhodan already faced during the Posbi cycle], all 
dead by now, short of finding energy. 
<P>The ship then reaches Barkonis, buzzing with activity, which is unusual. The 
Terrans learn that the Tefrodians arrived shortly before them and proposed to the 
Barkonids to fit generators on the planet, which would allow them to reach the 
Milky Way within a few weeks. In exchange, they asked the Barkonids to take with 
them a race of giant amoebas. The Barkonids accepted the deal. 
<P>The Terrans realize that this whole affair is a trap : the amoebas bear a 
deadly germ that would be fatal to all lifeforms in the Milky Way. Alerted, the 
Barkonids sacrifice themselves by destroying their planet.
