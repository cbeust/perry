With the Khrest 
III hard on its tail, the Susama hides near Big Blue, a blue giant. The 
Tefrodians create a hundred clones of Gucky and Andre' Lenoir, who teleport into 
the Khrest III to capture it. But the Terrans, aware of the threat, are able to 
repel the attack and the Khrest III eventually destroys the Susama.
