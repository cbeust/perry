The crew of the Base starts suffering from a rare disease called the Kybsoon effect, forcing the giant spaceship to stop on a planet.  Demeter seems affected by the proximity of the planet and starts behaving irrationally.  She remembers a part of her past.
<p>
During her mission to search for Laire's eye, Demetre and her crew arrived on a planet where she fell under the influence of a powerful psychic radiation.  She killed three natives before she regained control of her act.  The natives decided to let the Wyngians go but they planted a guilty memory in her head designed to come back to her memory occasionally.
