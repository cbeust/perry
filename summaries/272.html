While the 
Terrans are exploring Pigell (Vega VI), they are attacked by weird living 
clouds, which are able to teleport the Terrans to random places on the planet. 
The Terrans eventually join together and, using semi-intelligent dinosaurs 
dwelling on the planet, are able to communicate with the living clouds and make 
peace with them.
