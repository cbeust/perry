In order to restore the 
ship's initial size, Rhodan sends a commando to the south pole to destroy the 
dome. The commando is using antique jets, which engines don't seem to be 
affected by the reduction field. However, the aircrafts are attacked by flying 
robots and their pilots only barely make it back to the Khrest II. In the 
meantime, Rhodan learns that the domes were created during the war that once 
opposed the inhabitants of the yellow floor and those on the surface. The two 
people exterminated each other and only the robots remained on the surface.
