In the Milky 
Way, the Terrans are still looking for Kahalo, where the central command of the 
Sextuple transmitter is assumed to be. A ship is eventually able to locate the 
planet but the Masters of the Islands dispatch a fleet of cylindric ships 
through the transmitter at the same moment. These ships shoot some sort of death 
ray that destroys all life on the planet, including its inhabitants. The arrival 
of a huge Terran fleet prevents the cylindric ships from destroying the Purple 
Pyramids, where the central station is located. Despite superior firepower, the 
cylinders must flee in front of the Terran fleet. The terrans are now in control 
of the Purple Pyramids.
