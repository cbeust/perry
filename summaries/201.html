The Khrest II manages 
to take off but its Kalup engines, which can only fly over 600,000 light years, 
are not powerful enough to reach the Milky Way. On top of this, two strange 
phenomena are happening : all the water supplies disappear on board of the ship, 
and six of the seven planets are suddenly protected by an energy field. Only one 
planet -- Hope/Septim -- is accessible, but it looks barren.
