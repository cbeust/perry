The flying fortress of 
the Maahks attacks Raum/Quinta. It is protected by an undestructible green field 
and uses the dreadful Converter Guns. The Terrans fight with Transformer Guns 
and giga Arkonid bombs, the only weapons that seem to be able to get through the 
force field. They manage to keep the fortress away and stay in control of the 
Twin transmitter.
