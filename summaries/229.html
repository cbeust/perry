June 2401. 
Despite the loss of his fleet, Grek-1 wants to keep on fighting. But his ideas 
have evolved : he realized he is not fighting against Arkonids (who are old 
enemies to his race) but against Terrans, against which he has no revenge 
desire. However, he holds grudges against the Akonids, who are close to 
Arkonids. The hostility of the Akonids toward Rhodan convinces him to ally with 
the Terrans. After many discussions through the mutants, he surrenders to the 
Terrans, but blows his own ship up before doing so. In the same time, a strange 
phenomenon related to the special skills of the two wave runners causes the 
resurrection of Tronar Woolver. 230 - Finale für Twin <BR>The End of Twin <BR>H. 
G. Ewers 
<P>Grek-1 is taken to the Moon where he is questioned by Rhodan. Meanwhile, the 
Akonids learn about the Sextuple system and demand that the Terrans free the way 
through the transmitter. Moreover, they gather a fleet of 80,000 ships to impose 
their presence in the area. On Grek-1's recommendation, Rhodan evacuates the 
Sexutple system and opens the way to the Akonids, but he traps the Raum/Quinta 
station. The Akonids enter the Twin system and try to capture Raum/Quinta, but 
they then face a Maahk fleet coming from Horror, on its way to take on the Milky 
Way. Rhodan destroys Raum/Quinta, which isolates indefinitely the Maahk and 
Akonid fleets in the Twin system. The Akonids lose almost the entirety of their 
fleet and won't be a threat to the Solar Empire before a long time.
