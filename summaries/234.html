Rhodan leave 
Troja with the Khrest II on an exploration mission. After visiting an ice 
planet, where strange hallucinogen crystals grow [note from Cedric : these 
hypno-crystals will appear again in another cycle where they will have a great 
importance], the Khrest II approaches a wandering Moby which doesn't seem to 
react to their presence. It turns out most of the Mobies are dead, and their 
&quot;dead body&quot; is used as homes by a race called the Two-Noses. They are 
almost humanoid and are the main people of Androbeta. Using a powerful tractor 
beam, the Two-Noses capture the Khrest II and all the Terrans.
