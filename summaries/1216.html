In the Kesdschan cathedral, Lethos-Terakdschan tells Atlan his story...
<p>
<em>
After the destruction of Srakenduurn, Carfesch appeared on Khrat and told Lethos-Kerakdschan the story of the Moral Code of the Universe and what happened to Triicle-9.  The Sorgorian asks Lethos to go to the Abyss and assist the Space-Time Engineers in their task.  Lethos cannot take any possession with him but he is given the chance to memorize some of the technologies found in the Porleyter Vault before he leaves.
<p>
When he arrives in the Abyss, he falls into a trap laid out by the Gray Lords, which he manages to escape from thanks to Vagenda's help.  Lethos then takes control of a transmitter gate of the Starsen Wall and creates Steel Soldiers based on his memories.  In the years that follow, Lethos fights against the Brotherhood and the Geriocracy until he hears about the arrival of two Knights of the Abyss, which he assumes to be Jen Salik and Perry Rhodan.
</em>
<p>
Lethos offers Atlan to become a Knight of the Abyss but Atlan refuses, saying that the Cosmocrats deceived him in the past when he was sent beyond the Matter Sources and then turned into the Oracle of Krandhor without his agreement.  But in order to accomplish his task, Atlan accepts to receive the status of Knight of the Abyss temporarily, as long as this status will be stripped off once their mission is completed.
<p>
Atlan heads for the Grey Land, an area of Starsen that is controlled by the Grey Force, and in order to confront the two Gray Lords, he has to take off his activator.  As he realizes that he's now helpless, Jen Salik intervenes and saves Atlan with Vagenda's help.
<p>
With Starsen freed, Wolebol and Chulch accept to take over the task of the Steel Man while Lethos, Atlan, Jen Salik, now equipped with a new type of body armor more suitable for the Abyss, head for he Mountains of Creation.
