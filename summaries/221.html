Rhodan decides to send spies within Maahks' ranks. He asks 
five Terran officers, who are doomed by a deadly disease called the Plague of 
the Center. The five men pretend they are deserters and assist the Maahks 
prisoners to escape. Going through the Twin transmitter, they arrive on Horror 
where the Maahk fleet is gathering. Their mission is to collect information on 
the Maahks forces and send them to the Prometheus III, standing a few parsecs 
away from Horror. But the Maahks are not fooled by the stratagem. They send the 
five men through the Horror transmitter to a planet called Androcenter, within 
the Andro-Alpha nebula. Andro-Alpha is a micro-nebula orbiting around Andromeda, 
which is the new home of the Maahks since they fled the Milky Way.
