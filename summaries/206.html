At the last 
moment, the pilot of the cylindric ship modifies the settings of the 
transmitter, and instead of going back into the Milky Way, the Khrest II 
materializes inside a gigantic hollow world. This world, baptized Horror World, 
is an artificial planet made of four concentric layers. In the middle is a sun, 
which is where the Khrest II appears. Outside, three suns form a triangle around 
the planet. This artificial system is located 500,000 light years from 
Andromeda, 900,000 light years from the Milky Way and 300,00 light years away 
from the Twin system. The Khrest II barely escapes from energy-eating creatures 
and finds a tunnel through the inner planetary layer.
