After 
breaking through the third planetary layer, the Khrest reaches the &quot;yellow 
floor&quot;, where everything seems to have been destroyed by a nuclear war. The 
only survivors are seemingly innocent-looking dogs that actually have 
telepathetic powers, and which take control of the Terrans minds. Once again, 
Gucky and Tolot save the crew and free them from the influence of the animals.
