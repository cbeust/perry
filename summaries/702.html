<p>
A recent initiative of the Aphilians over the past years has been to create the so-called Silent Houses. These are places were old people are sent and are never heard of again. Vester, a non-Aphilian, also called an Outsider, decides to investigate.
<p>
Using a disguise, he penetrates one of the Silent Houses and soon finds out that although elderlies are well treated, their reason for being there is simply so that their organs can be reused when they die, in a typical Aphilian initiative. Vester's real identity is discovered and he has to escape.
