August 2400. Ichot 
Tolot, a Haluter, arrives on the base of Inversia. The Haluters are an old race 
of warriors, almost indestructible because they can alter their atomic 
structure. 50,000 years ago, they conquered the Milky Way but since then, gave 
up political power and live peacefully on Halut. Tolot found two men from the 
missing Terran ship Omaron and brought them back to Perry Rhodan. These men 
have gone mad, and the disappearance of the Omaron remains a mystery. Rhodan 
leaves on board of the Khrest II in order to find out what happened to the 
missing ship. Tolot joins them. 
<P>They soon discover an artificial system, made of six planets forming a 
hexagon. This system is actually a giant transmitter which sends the Khrest 2 in 
another solar system, 900,000 light years away from the Milky Way and 600,000 
light years from Andromeda. This system, named the Twin System, is also 
artificial : it is made of two stars around which orbit eight planets. Rhodan 
decides to land on a planet -- called Nightmare. They find the remnants of the 
Omaron, with the dead bodies of its crew. Suddenly, Nightmare begins to 
disintegrate.
