On the FRIDTJOF NANSEN, a Type II DISCOVERER of the Hayok fleet,
Julian Tifflor observes as an unfamiliar ship falls out from the
Jamondi star ocean hypercocoon and is attacked by three Kybb Cranar
cube ships that have also fallen into normal space. The manta ray
shaped ship destroys the cube ships in battle, but then stops in its
tracks as a solar system drops into normal space in its close
vicinity. A Terran boarding party boards the ship, a bionic cruiser,
and finds unconscious Motana. The intact ship's computer reboots and
takes offense at the Terrans presence, but when the Motana commander
awakens and Julian Tifflor intervenes personally by holo, it does
not take long before they sit down peacefully at the table and
exchange information. Tifflor thus learns all about the current
conditions in the star ocean and the background of recent events.
They separate friends - the Motana on the SHADOW PLAY want to
continue to hunt down more Kybb-Cranar with their bionic cruiser.

<p>

In the meantime, there are new difficulties on board the SWORD. The
Motanas, especially Zephyda, suffer from debilitating headaches and
lose their Psi-forces. Atlan supposes that there must be a Kyber-
Neutro near the cathedral. He and Lyressea search for it and find a
subterranean facility manned by robots, which had failed after the
activation of the DISTANCE TRAIL and now, after the conditions in
the Tan Jamondi system have returned to normal, reactivated. This
facility has presumably already been in operation since soon after
the Blood Night of Barinx, to guard the cathedral from any access by
Motanas. Lyressea takes on her second shape, which Altan perceives
as a metallic body, similar to a Cosmocrat robot, instead of a
dragon like Perry Rhodan had seen, and destroys the robot crew and
the Kyber-Neutro by herself. After a little while, the space quakes
in the whole star ocean massively increase in strength. All the Kybb-
Titans are drawn off to the third planet, Tan-Ice. Therefore the
path is free for the SWORD to lift off – and she rushes into the
DISTANCE TRAIL, in order to try retrieving the Paragon Cross.

<p>

On September 8, 1332 NGE, the star ocean of Jamondi is finally
completely thrown back into Einstein space. Hyper-hurricanes of
never before seen strength rage, producing space quakes and
distortions of the space time structure. After two days these
effects fade away, and the hypercocoon has completely dissolved. Now
the LFT ships can penetrate into the star ocean and go on the search
for the Rhodan and Atlan. But at the same time, Julian Tifflor can
only wonder what dangers have now been released, that ES had
presumably locked away in the hypercocoon.
