August 2402. 
Reginal Bell, who commands the solar fleet of the Lost System, sends additional 
cruisers to Androbeta. These cruisers are fit with super-engines that can cross 
the 400,000 light years that separate the micro-nebula from the Lost Word. Thus, 
they don't need the transmitter. When they reach Androbeta, they are confronted 
to an apparently dead Moby, but actually inhabited by some sort of intelligence 
existing in three instances, issued from the decaying brain of the Moby. 
Meanwhile, in the Two-Noses Moby, the civil war is still raging. Atlan 
eventually decides to blow the Moby up, for fear that their war might attract 
the Masters of the Island's attention.
