Ronald Tekener is asked by Rhodan to locate the Pirate Station and identify the Warner.  Tekener initially suspects Vishna, but the Cosmocrat denies having anything to do with it.  She says that she has already recovered all her scattered consciousnesses back inside her, except for Gesil and Srimavo who have acquired their own personality, thanks to the Knights of the Abyss.
<p>
Helped by Srimavo, Tekener discovers that the speaker of the Hanseatic League is connected to the Warner.  He used to be part of the Psi Cartel that helped create the fake Earth on the other side of the Moon during the conflict with Vishna, and the power he has acquired allows him to penetrate inside broadcasts.  He is assisted in his actions by Patricia Kllmeth and Celeste Maranitares.
<p>
A new broadcast from the Warner appears on all the screens, urging the humanity to choose the Third Way.
