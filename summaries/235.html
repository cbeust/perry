The 
Two-Noses are divided in three races, identified by the color of their two 
snout-looking noses (red, blue and white). Rhodan makes believe to the Red Noses 
(the upper race) that the Terrans came from a planet in Androbeta and have just 
discovered space travel. Deeming them as primitives, the Red Noses send them 
into the deep recesses of the Moby, with the White Noses (the lower race).
