The Terran scientists establish that it would be impossible to have fitted the Minhau with a Transdim drive on such a short notice.  Agen Thrumb explains that indeed, the Authorities of M-87 had decided several weeks ago that they were going to send the Terrans back to their home galaxy, for fear that their presence in M-87 would disturb the fragile equilibrium.  The Base Engineer dispatches a group of Blue scientist to help the Terrans adjust the transdim drive.
<p>
The Minhau heads for a triple sun system called Parjar where the adjustments must be made.  Once they are made, a quick test-drive of the engine is performed.  As soon as the engine starts, a recording taped by the head researcher of the original Terran commando is broadcast in the spaceship.
<p>
The Minhau has been equipped with a deviced called a dimensional transducer which is aligned on the gravitational constant of the Milky Way.  As soon as the Minhau would arrive in the Milky Way, the device would trigger a chain reaction that would cause all the stars in the galaxy to spontaneously self-combust.  Kulu realizes that his teleportation on the Minhau was part of a carefully thought out plan by the powers of M-87.
<p>
The Terrans evacuate the Minhau and are picked up by Fancan Teik.  The Minhau explodes and a blue singularity point is created in the middle of the triple system.
<p>
On the fortress, Rhodan and his commando are outnumber by the Dumfries and are forced to surrender to the Base Engineer.
