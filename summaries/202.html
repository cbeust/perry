In the Milky 
Way, a rescue operation is set up, thank to Box-8323, a Posbi ship (the Posbis 
are guessed to be the most capable of resisting the transition and escape 
whatever danger lies beyond the transmitter). Box-8323 enters the Sextuple 
transmitter and arrives in the Twin system. They rescue the Khrest II crew just 
before they die out of thirst. Rhodan decides to keep on exploring the planets 
of the system in order to find out how the Twin transmitter can be used to get 
back to the Milky Way. 
<P>Thanks to gravitation bombs, the Khrest II manages to break through the 
energy field of one of the planets -- Athena/Sexta. The Terrans find strange 
devices on the surface but are unable to start them.
