January 2404. Three space ships approach the Terran fleet. 
They come from Ollura, a nearby planet. These ships are very primitive, they fly 
below the speed of light and it took them several years to reach this point. 
They are piloted by dwarves, the Bio-Decomposers. Their technological level 
being very low, Rhodan lets them come aboard, making a dramatic mistake : using 
hypnotic powers, they capture the Khrest III and only Rhodan and a few others 
manage to escape from them.
