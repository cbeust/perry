November 
2402. The mutants hear a powerful psychic call for help. The scientists locate 
the emission on a distant planet, called Margin, on the edge of Androbeta. 
Rhodan goes there and finds a whole living planet, made of protoplasm. Ships 
sent by the Masters of the Island regularly show up, take a portion of the 
protoplam, and leave, causing a great pain to the protoplasm being. Talking with 
the planet, Rhodan finds out that Margin is actually the original protoplasm 
that created the Posbis and their homeworld, the World-of-the-Hundred-Suns. 
Willing to keep the promise he made to the Posbis in 2114, Rhodan tries to help 
the planet by fighting its exploiters, but it fails, and the Masters of the 
Islands choose to destroy the protoplasmic planet.
