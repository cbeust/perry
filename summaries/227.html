Using a stratagem involving an Akonid ship, Grek-1 sends 
Tronar's clone on Kahalo. But Grek-1 isn't aware that Rakar saw the 
multiduplicator and knows that his brother died on the ship. The Terrans 
neutralize the fake Tronar and Rakar takes his place. Meanwhile, on the Maahk 
ship, Grek-1 is setting up a huge Pulse Disruptor, which will be able to 
materialize a whole Maahk fleet within the Milky Way.
