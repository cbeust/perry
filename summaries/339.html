Tschubai and Kulu find shelter in a cave, where they meet a snow gorilla who seems to possess telekinetic powers.  Suddenly, Kulu and the gorilla disappear in front of Tschubai's eyes.  Kulu and his companion have been teleported on a different level of reality, and they keep being bounced into different places until they end up on a planet that seems to be close to the center of M-87, since the radiance is a lot stronger here.  The planet, which they baptize Flare, seems to be an important control center.
<p>
On Truuktan, Marshall and Rhodan befriend a Kobalt who tell them about the masters of M-87, called the Builders of the Center.  A long time ago, the Builders assigned tasks to the various races in M-87 in order to achieve a maximum efficiency, but this organization has been falling apart recently.  Marshall locates the Skovarto in a nearby cell and they make contact with him.  He looks a lot like a Halutian and agrees to cooperate with the Terrans when he learns that all his people came with them.
<p>
The Skovarto explains that the Skovars used to be the soldier cast of M-87 but they have now been replaced by another race, the Kurlux.  The Skovars Rhodan met are the Skovarto's elite soldiers, which he sent away in an attempt to save them.
<p>
After going through the room of a thousand terrors, where they have to face powerful illusions, the Terrans and the Skovarto attempt to escape from the fortress.
