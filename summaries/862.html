On the Earth, Tifflor receives a message for help from Harno, who is still in Gaia.  Worried, Tifflor dispatches Homer Adams coupled with the consciousness of Betty Toufry to Provcon-Faust.  Hotrenor-Taak volunteers to join them.
<p>
In Gaia, Harno has developed an area around himself that Hotrenor-Taak identifies as a time bubble.  Harno asks Hotrenor-Taak to take him to Mugnammor, a planet two hundred light years away.  When they get there, Harno's time bubble expands and both of them are hurled eight thousand years in the past, on the Earth.
<p>
Harno and Hotrenor-Taak witness a ceremony on the island of Crete where a woman called Demeter, and obviously not of Terran origin, is receiving gifts from natives adoring her.
<p>
In the present, Homer Adams and Betty Toufry arrive on Mugnammor and after being sent to a more recent past themselves, they return to the present where they install a project that soon brings back Hotrenor-Taak and Harno to the present.  Harno says that what happened was caused by an entity that he can't identify.  Hotrenor-Taak then leaves for an unknown destination.
<p>
On the Earth, Czerk Matzlew, the archeologist in charge of the dig in Crete, tells Tifflor that he unearthed a huge room.  Tifflor leaves for Crete.
