The Terrans must 
abandon Artis to the Mobies. They relocate on Androbeta's fringe. The Khrest II 
scientists calculate that there are nine possible sources in Androbeta from 
which the hyperwave can be emitted. Rhodan sends nine mosquitos (small and fast 
ships) to investigate these spots. Eight ships find nothing of interest but the 
eighth one discovers a system made of three aligned stars, called the Triad 
system. Around the central star orbits the planet Gleam [Cedric: probably called 
the Swamp Planet and renamed by our restless and always creative French 
translator. And to an English name on top of that :-)]
