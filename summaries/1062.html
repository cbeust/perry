The two Darghetians face traps left by the Porleyters and they crash on the planet they were investigating.  They discover signs of a civilization that was apparently devastated in a distant past by an infection.  The bodies they find show that the inhabitants were a mix of humanoids and felines.  Seth Apophis tells the Darghetians about the Terrans, describing them as criminals.
<p>
Pushing their investigation further, they discover a Porleyter station and inside, two crab-looking creatures covered by a hard chitinous shell.  They understand that the lifeless bodies are designed to host consciousnesses.  Using the devices of the station, they transfer their consciousness inside the crab bodies and resume their research.
