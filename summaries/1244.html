<p>
After erasing Tekener's memory, Homer G. Adams goes into hiding with the actual Warner, whose knowledge is so important that he must be protected from the Decalogue at all costs.
<p>
The twenty billion brains of the Anin Ans spread on the Earth and receive the name Technosats.  Their first effect is to disrupt all positronic-based technology, plunging the Earth into chaos.  Soon thereafter, they take over the airwaves and subject every person of the population to a radiation that puts them into a deep sleep called Hypnotrance.
<p>
Soon, three quarters of the Earth population have fallen to the Hypnotrance and only the mutants, Psycho-stabilized people and Swingers, former members of the Psycho-Trust, are immune.  One of them, Gopher, receives a direct communication from 1-1-Nannor, the Anin-An leader, asking him to surrender.  Gopher refuses and successfully fights back.
<p>
In the Spirit of Reason, Kazzenkatt is satisfied with how things are going and calculates that in a few days, the Chronofossil Terra will have been completely deactivated.  He is also looking forward to seeing Rhodan come back to the Earth, where a deadly trap will then kill him.
