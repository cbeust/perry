Icho Tolot and Fancan Teik meet Perry Rhodan and let him know that they have uncovered information about the Magellan Cloud.  70,000 years ago, a hundred Halutians left on an exploration mission into Magellan and never made it back.  The only thing left from them was a message saying "Banned forever in the kingdom of the First Frequential Power".
<p>
Near Modula, the Terrans finally uncover the Dolan and engage him.  The Terran fleet is destroyed within minutes by a powerful weapon fired by the Dolan, later dubbed Vibration Cannon.  A few spaceships escape and report to Rhodan, who arrives shortly thereafter. 
<p>
Icho Tolot and Fancan Teik engage the Dolan, using their own advanced paratron field, and the two spaceships seem to reach a statu quo, unable to pursue the hostilities without risking mutual destruction.
<p>
Rhodan establishes contact with Tro-Khon, but his attempts at explaining that the time infraction was actually committed by the Masters of the Island are met by a deaf ear.  The Guardian is here to punish the Terrans, and he will carry out the sentence.
