Questioning Frasbur, 
the Terrans discover that there is another time transmitter on the sixth planet 
of Vega. This transmitter is less powerful and will only allow time shifts of 
five hundred years in the future. They also learn that Vega VIII, which the 
Terrans visited during the quest for IT in the very first episodes, is a Lemur 
colony that was destroyed by the Haluters. The Ferrolians are thus descendants 
of the survivors, who mutated because of the radiations. The Lemurs are most 
likely the ancestors of all people in the Milky Way. 
<P>The Khrest III is suddenly uncovered and attacked by the Lemurs. Rhodan 
decides to head for the Vega VI transmitter, hoping that in the near future, the 
Lemurs will have been defeated by the Haluters and will no longer be a threat to 
the Terrans. With a surprise attack, the Khrest III destroys the small base of 
the Masters of the Island on Vega VI, activates the time transmitter and leaps 
five hundred years toward the present.
