Demeter meets Roi Danton and asks to take part in the trip that the Base will soon undertake.
<p>
On the Earth, several Metamorphs take the appearance of some key Base engineers and manage to get transfered on the giant station.
<p>
On Olymp, Hotrenor-Taak is still trying to redeem himself and he is actively looking for the Metamorphs in the underground installations.  Tengri Lethos eventually discovers them, even though he hasn't recovered fully yet.  The Guardian of the Light takes a trip in the past and realizes that Larens used to live on Olymp.  Hotrenor-Taak, the two men find out that in a distant past, the Larens fought and defeated a terrible enemy in the Milky Way.  When the Laren finally meets with Tengri Lethos, he captures him, thinking that he is dealing with a Metamorph.
