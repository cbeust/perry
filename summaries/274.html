During the fight against the creatures of Pigell, a Terran 
commando is strayed and is forced to flee through a transmitter. The Terrans 
arrive on the Earth, where they meet with the few descendants of the survivors 
of a war against the Haluters. They try to survive on this forsaken Earth, 
wholly covered with ice.
