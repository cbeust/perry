With the 
Terran crew under their complete hypnotic control, the Bio-Decomposers force the 
Khrest III to go to Ollura. Rhodan follows them there and with Kalak's help, he 
can gain control of the Khrest III and free his men. But tough fights ensue and 
all the Bio-Decomposers must be exterminated. Rhodan fears that the Masters of 
the Island might be alerted that the Terrans have entered their territory.
