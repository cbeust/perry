Rhodan decides to go on Tefrod, the Tefrodian's main 
planet, to gather information on the Masters of the Island. But the planet is 
closely protected and the mutants do not represent a significant advantage over 
the Tefrodians since these also have mutants. The expedition is a complete 
failure, but Rhodan and the commando are able to escape. Rhodan learns that no 
Tefrodian has ever seen a Master of the Island, except for their chief, the 
Virth, who lives in an extremely well protected island.
