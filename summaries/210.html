In the Milky 
Way, the Terrans have built the Prometheus, a ship with an autonomy of one 
million light years. Along with two Posbi ships, the Prometheus goes through the 
Sextuple transmitter and reaches the Twin system. The crew discovers on Chaos 
and Terra indications that the Khrest II was formerly there. On Raum/Quinta, an 
examination of the central station reveals where the Khrest II was headed. The 
Prometheus and the Posbi ships are able to reach the Horror World without having 
to go through the transmitter and arrive there just as the Khrest II, making its 
way through the last planetary layer, eventually breaks free. The Prometheus 
then heads back toward the Milky Way with orders for Julian Tifflor, who is in 
charge of the Terran fleet during Rhodan's absence : to occupy the Twin system 
and dispatch to Horror another long-range ship, the Prometheus II.
