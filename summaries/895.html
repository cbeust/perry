Rhodan notices a strange resemblance between the Anskians and a race that they discovered on the planet First Impression.  Rhodan communicates this information to the Base and then, the Terrans retreat.  The Anskians reconquer the headquarters but don't find anything.

Ganerc-Callibso reaches the Plan, which seems to be partially destroyed.  He comes on board of a space station where he meets with an entity call Skrinus.  Ganerc asks for the permission to enter a forbidden area of the Plan, which Skrinus grants him.  Inside, Ganerc triggers a security device that tells him that he is not supposed to have access to this area, and that in punishment, he will no longer be allowed to return to his cosmic fortress.
<p>
When he attempts to return to his cosmic fortress, Ganerc realizes that it has disappeared.
