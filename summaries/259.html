Now aware of the imminent 
arrival of the Maahks in Andromeda, Rhodan decides to step aside to see how the 
confrontation between them and the Tefrodians will turn out. A first stellar 
battle takes place, won by the Maahks. Rhodan takes advantage of the outcome of 
the battle to capture a Tefrodian ship. The members of the ship fight like lions 
and just as they are about to fall in the hands of the Terrans, suddenly drop 
dead. Examining the dead bodies, the Terrans find out that the Tefrodians have, 
implanted in their brain, the small devices discovered previously by the crew of 
the mosquito. These devices allow the Masters of the Islands to have full 
control, including death, over the Tefrodians, even remotely, using hyperwaves. 
During the fight, Rhodan discovered on a desert planet a little robot, calling 
itself Log, who possesses paranormal skills (teleportation and telepathetic).
