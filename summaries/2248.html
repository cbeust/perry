Freedomfighters

After losing the battle against the Kybb, Zephyda sends out her 
      remaining thirty-nine cruisers to gather all the reachable Planetary 
      Majesties for a Convention of the Majesties. She herself remains with 
      the SWORD on Tom Karthay. The Medial Sentry Lyressea awakens there on 
      August 6, 1332 NGE. She is a positive moral being. With great 
      sympathy for the Galacticans, Motanas and Rorkhete, she begins to tell 
      them about the past. 
<p>
      
      Six Sentries  three male and three female humanoids  are 
      created by ES (IT) seven million years ago on Wanderer ( Ambur, at 
      that time) from the gene pool of the planet Talan (aka Terra) and 
      Homunk, who comes from the same gene pool, prepares them over several 
      centuries for their task to help the Order of the Protectors. The 
      Protectors at that time were an organization like the Knights of the 
      Depth. They had their seat of power in the Jamondi star cluster, on 
      the planet Tan-Jamondi II, this was also the location of their 
      cathedral, a building in form of an enormous cone, which was 
      integrated with a gigantic tree and was known as the Rogan Cathedral.


      <p>
According to legend the Order would be blessed, as long as the tree 
          bloomed. A mysterious being by the name of Orrien Alar, which could 
          melt with the tree, the Ancient Trummstam, guarded it. Up to now the 
          Protectors had been able to receive their consecration only in the 
          Rogan Cathedral because a mental entity had merged with the 
          cathedral. The Protectors had eventually renounced working for the 
          Cosmocrata. They no longer wanted to follow the rigid rules of the 
          forces of Order, but live according to their own moral principles. 
<p>
The Cosmocrats agreed to it, however, with the demand of removing the 
          mental entity from the Rogan Cathedral, so that no more new 
          Protectors could be consecrated. 

<p>
          
          To retain the Order from extinction, new Protectors came to be 
          consecrated in the future by the Sentries. It would only work though, 
          with the help of the Paragon Cross, a psionic field in which a 
          fragment of the consciousness of ES was integrated. Only absolutely 
          positive beings could be consecrated as Protectors, and the final 
          decision stood with the Paragon Cross. As an other present, the 
          Sentries received some thousand newborn children and ten thousand 
          fetuses from Homunk of a race that carries the name Motana. ES 
          created the Motana from the current gene pool of Talan, and projected 
          the likely development of life on Talan  i.e. the Motana 
          correspond to the intelligent form of life which would develop itself 
          on Talan only after another seven million years: Humans. 
<p>
          
          A prosperous period begins for the Order of the Protectors. The 
          Sentries look for and test particularly "suitable" beings of all 
          possible races and begin to consecrate new Protectors. These 
          Protectors maintain order and security in Ammandul (aka the Milky 
          Way) in a peaceful manner, settling conflicts without using their 
          superior military power. The strongest spaceships of the Protectors 
          are the Transports: seven kilometers long, rust red cylindrical 
          ships. However, the Shozides form the backbone of the fleet with 
          their double ringed ships. As they grow up and develop over the 
          millennia, the Motana spread out all over Jamondi and become an 
          important helper race for the Protectors. Their main world is the 
          planet Barinx. 
<p>
          
          The Protectors spread out their sphere of influence over several star 
          clusters in Ammandul. One of them is Arphonie and it lies near Talan. 
          Another such star cluster lies in Amringhar (aka the Greater 
          Magellanic Cloud) and is called Parrakhon. One of the "newer" 
          Protectors is Tagg Kharzani, a somber humanoid, tall and thin as a 
          skeleton who always wears a wide brimmed hat that keeps his head 
          covered in shadow. Another new Protector is Gon-Orbhon. Lyressea 
          found him in a rescue capsule, which floated in the empty space 
          between Amringhar and Ammandul. He cannot remember his past, but 
          seems to be an artificially created being. With his ability to 
          mentally control intelligent beings from a distance, he ends a 
          terrible war between the Kybb races in Amringhar and Khyranghar ( aka 
          the Smaller Magellanic Cloud).

      <p>
On Gon-Orbhons persuading, a second 
          Protector Cathedral is established in Amringhar with part of the 
          Paragon Cross on the planet Parrakh in which consecrations can also 
          take place. The pacified Kybb races are integrated into the 
          organization of the Protectors. The Kybb establish a monstrous 
          building in the Arphonie star cluster for Tagg Kharzani. It is the 
          Kherzesch Castle  
<p>          
          One day the amphibian Carya Andaxi is consecrated a Protector. She 
          had once been a representative of the Cosmocrats, but no longer works 
          for the forces of Order. She is practically the embodiment of 
          positive morality. She repeatedly speaks of a legendary place by the 
          name of Ahandaba, which cannot be reached with the conventional means 
          of space travel. She begins to promote the psionic potential 
          slumbering in the Motana for psionic space travel. Tagg Kharzani 
          develops an aversion towards Carya Andaxi and her stories of 
          Ahandaba. It turns out that Kharzani suffers from Thanatophobia  
          he has a morbid fear of death. Carya Andaxi withdraws to the water 
          world Gray Foam, which supposedly resembles her home planet and lies 
          very close to Kherzesch Castle. From there she returns with a new 
          type of ship developed by the Submarine Architects, developed 
          specially for the Motanas. With these "bionic cruisers" the 
          Motana 
          begin to more and more replace the Shozides.
      <p>
Along with the bionic 
          cruisers, Carya&nbsp; brings the Schota Maghate, nicknamed the Oceanic 
          Oracles, from Gray Foam  rumors say that the Oceanic Oracles are 
          Carya Andaxi's children. 
<p>
          
          Hard times begin when the Sentries receive a summons from Homunk: the 
          helper races of the negative superintelligence STROWWAN will soon 
          attack Ammandul. STROWWAN is pursuing the goal of changing into a 
          matter depression. The war soon begins and for the first time the 
          Protectors must use deadly force. New Protectors are no longer 
          consecrated, and Wanderer withdraws into hyperspace. 
      <p>
During this 
            time, the Sentries receive their titles. Lyressea becomes the Medial 
            Sentry, due to her mental sensitivity. Catiaane becomes the Brass 
          Sentry for her propensity to continue trying to make peace. Metondre 
          became the Lover Sentry, for his trying to find the good even in the 
          worst enemies. Eithani was the Burning Sentry because he burned for 
          justice and revenge for all those killed. Atjaa was the Steel Sentry 
          for his indomitable will to survive. Hytath became the Bleeding 
          Sentry for his willingness to accept sacrifice for the greater good, 
          but feeling the sorrow for the necessity of it... 
          
          After eight hundred and ninety-eight years of war, the decisive 
          battle begins between STROWWAN'S horde and the combined fleets of 
          all the races of the Milky Way under the leaderships of the Protectors ...
