The Masters of the 
Island, alerted that the Vega transmitter was used, take advantage of the 
arrival on the Earth of the Terran commando to lay out a trap for the Khrest 
III. One of them, Toser-Ban, uses the commando as a bait and attracts the Khrest 
III on the Earth, where he tries to destroy it. Thanks to a lucky turn of 
events, the trap fails and the Terran commando is safely rescued.
