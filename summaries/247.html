Tenebria is 
under the commandment of Saar-Lun, a Modul. The Moduls were once one of the 
humanoid races of Andromeda, but they were enslaved by the Masters of the 
Island. Saar-Lun has a specific skill that allows him to turn energy into 
matter. The Masters of the Island force him to use his power to give life to the 
androids, created on Tenebria out of pieces of protoplasm taken on Margin. 
Saar-Lun hates the Masters of the Islands, but he is perduaded that if he 
rebels, the Masters will exterminate his whole race. So, he fights against the 
Terrans until Rhodan proves him that the Masters of the Island have already 
exterminated his race, and that he is the last of them. Saar-Lun surrenders and 
joins the Terrans. He stops producing the androids and the suicide raids stop.
