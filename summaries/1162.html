<p>
The Third Plague attacks the Earth through a hole in the Gray Corridor.  New viruses erupt that cause the flora and the insects to grow extremely fast.  Humanoid creatures come out of the cocoons formed by the altered plants.  They call themselves Xeno and Terran scientists determine that they come from a different universe.
<p>
Communication is established by the Xeno and they tell the Terrans they were captured by accident in the Grey Corridor.  They didn't realize they were altering intelligent creatures and when they realize their error, they withdraw their creations.  They finally leave the Earth in peace, leaving behind them several new organismes and viruses to assist the Terrans.
