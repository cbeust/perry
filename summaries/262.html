All of a sudden, the 
device that was responsible for the immortality of the inhabitants of History 
stops working, causing their death. Then, the Khrest III is attacked by 
Tefrodians ships. During the skirmish, the Terrans learn that the Tefrodians think 
the Khrest III is actually a Haluter ship. But, according to Ichot Tolot, the 
Haluters don't know about the Tefrodians. Thanks to its transform cannons, the 
Khrest III wins the fight, but heavily damaged, it has to find out shelter on a 
planet called Multika, where a little Tefrodian base is found. As the repairs 
start, a commando is sent out to find more about the planet, and the Terrans 
discover that the Tefrodians possess multiduplicators. This accounts for the 
strange likeness of the guardians of History : the Masters of the Island use the 
multiduplicators to create, in the central area of Andromeda, an army of 
faithful and disciplined clones.
