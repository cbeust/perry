A strange 
hyperwave is beginning to irradiate through Androbeta. This hyperwaves wakes all 
the Mobies up and they start to destroy methodically all the inhabited planets 
of the micro-galaxy. It seems that the Masters of the Islands eventually 
suspected the presence of the Terrans and are going to great lengths to make 
sure they won't survive. A Moby attacks and destroys Destroy, and then moves on 
to Artis, but the Terrans are able to eliminate it thanks to the para-sprinters 
(the Woolver brothers). But they know all they did was gaining some time 
<P>Meanwhile, after a parapsychic experience, an OSU officer is transfered for a 
few hours into a parallel universe where he meets with a telepathetic robot on 
some dark planet. This robot explains that he has been waiting for his masters 
for a thousand years, but the Terran can't learn anything more.
