September 2402. Rhodan decides to explore the first 
planet of the Ha'lurin system. It is baptized Destroy and looks like it was 
devastated by a nuclear holocaust. Pushing the investigation further, Rhodan is 
stunned to discover Laurins dwelling beneath the surface. This confirms the 
origin of the Laurins, which had always been suspected to come from Andromeda. 
The Masters of the Islands sent the Laurins to invade the Galaxy three centuries 
ago. After the Laurins failed, the Masters of the Islands exiled them on 
Destroy, and then destroyed the planet. The surviving Laurins are now hiding to 
escape from the Masters.
