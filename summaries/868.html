In April 3586, the Base leaves the Earth under the command of Payne Hamiller and Jentho Kanthall.  Roi Danton, who has fallen in love with Demeter / Dunjia Varenczy, is also on board.  One night, Hamiller overhears Demeter speaking in her sleep and mentioning that she has to look for an Eye, a quest that will eventually lead her in a city called Henoch.  As the Base is leaving, Kershyll Vanne receives an alarming message from <em>It</em> saying "I tried to help but I failed.  I came too close, and now I am falling into this extinct...".
<p>
In Drakrioch, Rhodan receives the same message from <em>It</em> and the Sol soon departs for Tschuschik.
<p>
On the Base, an entity named Dargist starts attacking the crew.  It's a defense mechanism installed during the former Aphilian program that received the orders to destroy any non-Aphilian being.  Augustus, the K2 robot, makes contact with Dargist and pretends the crew is under its command.  The attacks stop.
