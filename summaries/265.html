Rhodan decides 
to explore Vario, the only planet of the blue giant. But this planet is actually 
another trap laid out by the Masters of the Island : the Khrest III is cast 
50,000 years into the past. Only a small pod is able to escape. The Khrest III 
is then taken to the center of Andromeda where it is sent back into the Milky 
Way through another giant transmitter. It arrives near Kahalo where the crew is 
arrested by a human-like people : the Lemurs. Pretending they are Tefrodians, 
Rhodan and Atlan learn that that have arrived in the middle of the war between 
the Haluters and the Lemurs. These Lemurs possess a huge galactic empire and 
came from a lost continent on the Earth : Lemuria, which was located in the 
Pacific ocean. They are losing the war against the Haluters, and for the past 
century, have been evacuating progressively the Milky Way toward Andromeda 
(where they are called Tefrodians). They are the creators of the transmitters, 
and not the Masters of the Island. Akonids and Arkonids are actually desendants 
from the Lemurian colonies that successfully evaded the Haluters, while the 
Terrans are direct descendants from the Lemurs who could survive on the Earth 
after the war against the Haluters. Thanks to the time transmitter, the Masters 
of the Island were able to create a bridge between the Lemurian's Milky Way and 
the present Andromeda. They have spies among the Lemurs and capture the 
brightest of them to send them into the present, where they are then cloned and 
used are officers in the Tefrodians ranks. 
<P>Striving to rejoin the present, the Terrans (pretending they are Tefrodians 
come back to help their Lemur brothers against the Haluters) talk the Lemurs 
into allowing them to land on the Earth. But the Khrest III is quickly 
identified by the spies from the Masters of the Island on the Earth.
