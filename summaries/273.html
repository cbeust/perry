A new danger arises 
for the Terrans : strange energy-absorber mosquitos neutralize the Khrest III 
while tentacular plants and flame thrower snakes attack them. Rhodan eventually 
finds out that all these attacks are commanded by a cave race of bat-looking 
humans. These creatures, the Icas, actually came from Andromeda. They were 
created by a group of Paddlers specialized in genetics, who were themselves 
genetically modified. They were banned in time and space by the Masters of the 
Island and attacked the Terrans because they confused them with Tefrodians.
