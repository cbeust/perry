July 2402. Using 
the transmitter of the Lost System, the Terrans are teleported into the 
micro-nebula Androbeta, 400,000 light years away. This micro-nebula, which looks 
like Androalpha, orbits around the Andromeda galaxy. In order not to draw 
attention upon them, the Terrans build a base inside an asteroid (Troja) found 
within the Lost System. Inside, he stores five super-cruisers, including the 
Khrest II, and sends the asteroid through the transmitter. Troya reaches a the 
system of Beta-Triangle, and Rhodan's plan is a success : the guardians of the 
Androbeta transmitter are not alerted by this innocent-looking asteroid, 
probably captured by mistake by the transmitter. 
<P>Some time later, the asteroid is swallowed by a Moby, a kind of living 
planet. These Mobies are the super-guardians of Androbeta, and wander about the 
nebula, swallowing everything that goes by. As they are about to be 
&quot;digested&quot;, the Terrans kill the planetoid from inside and are able to 
escape.
