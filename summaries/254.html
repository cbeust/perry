Rhodan simulates 
a nuclear accident on Ollura in order to fool possible Masters of the Islands 
spies there. The plan works : three ships appear to examine examine Ollura, and 
leave. Rhodan decides not to stay around. Respecting the promise he made to 
Kalak, the Terrans set on a search for other stations built by the Galactic 
Engineers. According to Kalak, another station might have escaped to the Masters 
of the Islands by hiding in a nearby gas nebula. The Khrest III follows his 
directions and finds the Emerald system. On its second planet, covered with a 
thick forest, they find a wrecked station. The jungle turns out being a unique 
vegetal being capable of thought, who captures Rhodan and some other Terrans.
