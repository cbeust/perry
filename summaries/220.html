A few Maahks 
were able to leave the fortress before it blew up. They contact the Akonids, 
long time enemies to the Arkonids and the Solar Empire. The Akonids help the 
Maahks to settle on Metha, a desertic methan planet. An Akonid ship captures the 
strayed mutants and turns them in to the Maahks. Once on Metha, the mutants 
escape the Maahks and warn the Terran fleet, which then destroys the Maahk 
colony.
