As the war between 
Tefrodians and Maahks tilt in favor of the Tefrodians, whose anti-polar gun turns 
out to be more efficient than the Maahks convert guns, Rhodan tries to use the 
captured Tefrodian starship as a Trojan horse to break into their realm. But the 
Tefrodians send this ship for repair through a giant transmitter. The attempt is 
a complete failure and Rhodan and his men will only barely escape. The Khrest 
III, which also went through the transmitter, is uncovered and followed by a 
whole Tefrodian fleet. The Terrans eventually lose their pursuers.
