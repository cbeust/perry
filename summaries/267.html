Pursued by a Lemur 
fleet, the Khrest III hides within the galactic center. The Terrans find another 
stellar base of the Paddlers, MA-Genial. The base is also trapped in the past by 
the Masters of the Islands. The Terrans help the Paddlers to repel a Haluters 
attack and the Paddlers become their allies.
