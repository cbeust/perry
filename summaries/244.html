The way to Androbeta is free again. Rhodan returns to 
Troja, still drifting in the micro-nebula, in order to find another planet where 
a new base could be built. The Terrans then realize that all the Two-Noses are 
fleeing from Androbeta, abandoning their bases and their planets. Rhodan decides 
to settle in Androbeta anyway and picks Gleam as their main base. This decision 
causes IT to appear, and He informs Rhodan that this capital decision will take 
him to Andromeda and will later lead to the destruction of a &quot;great 
race&quot;. On Gleam, the Terrans find Harno, their old spheric friend, who 
assists them in chasing psychic creatures causing them difficulties.
