With the help of the barbarians, Atlan is busy trying to act as a diplomat beteween various Armada Units in dispute.  He receives the impulses from the Lukyoons and dispatch a mission there, which finds the five thousand Lukyoon spaceships devastated.  The only thing left is an intert protoplasmic mass, which makes Atlan think the Lukyoons merged before dying.
