Rhodan and Atlan meet and it's clear that they won't reach an agreement.  Rhodan asks his old friend if he can get a spaceship from the NEI.  Atlan initially refuses but when Rhodan wins a popular vote, the Arkonide is forced to give him what he wants.  Disappointed by the attitude of his friend, Rhodan and his crew leave Provcon-Faust.
<p>
On his side, Atlan asks to meet Hotrenor-Taak, which the Laren quickly accepts.  Accompanied by Julian Tifflor, Atlan meets the Laren commander and tells him that Rhodan intends to move against him.  Atlan tries to make a deal with Hotrenor-Taak:  he promises that the NEI will not assist Rhodan in return, the Larens do not retalliate against civil populations when the conflict breaks out.
<p>
Hotrenor-Taak refuses and tries to capture the two men, who manage to escape from the trap laid out by the Laren.
