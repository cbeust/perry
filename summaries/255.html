As Rhodan and his friends are 
escaping from the Emerald vegetal being, the Khrest III is surrounded by a 
series of hallucinations that make the ship drift away from the second planet. 
The source of these fantasies is identified as coming from Emerald I, where a 
powerful being is trying to hypnotize them. After destroying it, the Khrest II 
gets back on Emerald II. Meanwhile, on the planet, Rhodan finds out that the 
Paddlers who survived the crash have been fighting the Emerald being for the 
past 800 years. With the Terrans help, they escape and destroy Emerald II.
