The Khrest II gets back to Troja, where it is joined by 
the cruisers sent by Bell. Rhodan is looking for a discrete planet where the 
Terrans could build a base. He finds it in the Ha'lurin system, on the second 
planet -- Artis, an ice world. The Terrans build the base under the ice, but one 
of the cruisers is spotted by a Two-Noses squadron. The cruiser successfully 
evades the Two-Noses, making them think it actually came from Androalpha, the 
Maahks micro-nebula.
