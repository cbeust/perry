May 2401. The Terrans 
discover by chance the dead body of a member of the Kitara's crew, which 
convinces Rhodan that the agents are really Maahk agents. Meanwhile, the 
duplicates start the Pulse Disruptor and materialize a Maahk ship inside the 
Milky Way. One of the Terran ships eventually discovers the Kitara and the enemy 
ship but fails to capture it. The Maahk ship disappears. In order to infiltrate 
the Terran ranks, Grek-1, the commandant of the Maahk vessel, leaves the five 
duplicates on the Kitara. They are rescued by the Terrans and explain that the 
Kitara was attacked by the Maahk ship and that they are the only suvivors. The 
Terrans pretend they believe them but Rhodan now knows for sure they are 
traitors.
