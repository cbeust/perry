In Navo-North, the Khrest keeps a close watch on Old Man, which is under control of the hypno-crystals.  Felmer Lloyd has been behaving strangely over the past days, and when he finally collapses in violent pain, the doctors find out that he has been infected by a small creature called a Bleep.  The Bleep has been installed on the mutant by Tro-Khon and it spies on the Terrans every move.  Pucky manages to capture it.
<p>
A Dolan materializes near Old Man, who attacks it right away.  The Terrans decide to side with him, trying to prove him they are not enemies.  Tro-Khon manages to land on Old Man and once there, he takes control of the giant base.  Pucky tries to teleport on the base but he lands on a spaceship from Old Man, which is then set on an automatic course toward a planet.
<p>
On this planet, Pucky meets the Brels, who were once sentenced by the Frequential Guardians because of the native ability to travel through time.  After a quick trip back in time to meet a famous Brel astronomer, Pucky manages to find where the planet is located and then heads back toward Navo-North.
<p>
He arrives there as Old Man starts sending out his fleet to attack the Terrans.
