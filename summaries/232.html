Rhodan asks Bell to join him with his 
fleet and together, they face and defeat the Maahks. But as they come nearer to 
the transmitter, Gucky's ship triggers a time trap, and he is cast one thousand 
years back in time, while the Masters of the Island were attacking the planet. 
Thanks to Gucky, the Masters of the Islands suffer heavy losses and some of the 
Maahks manage to survive. Gucky is able to come back into the present, and 
Rhodan is finally able to make peace with the Maahks by convincing them they 
were not sent by the Masters of the Island.
