On their 
return, the duplicates are seen as heroes, except for Atlan, who is fairly 
familiar with the Maahks and can't believe they would have let their prisoners 
escape. He suspects the five agents to have been somehow conditioned by the 
Methanians, but since they are in all points identical to their original 
couterparts, he cannot prove his theory. The duplicates are sent on a shore 
leave on Inversia, on the ship Kitara. Once they're on their way, the agents 
hijack the ship, kill the crew and blow the vessel up, simulating an accident. 
This incident confirms Atlan in his believings. A thorough examination of the 
area where the accident happened reveals nothing. 
<P>In the meantime, the duplicates are joined by an immaterial sphere sent to 
them by the Masters of the Islands. This sphere contains a new device, the Pulse 
Disruptor, that will allow the Maahk ships to use the Sextuple transmitter 
without having to materialize near it. If the Disruptor is activated, the Maahks 
will thus be able to materialize wherever they wish in the galaxy.
