Still unconscious, Seth Apophis remembers her past...
<p>
<em>In a distant past
<p>
The Parsynians live in the galaxy Uxford and have recently developed a new device called the Announcer designed to allow them to enlarge their perception of the world.  They create a fleet of spaceships called the Missionaries and start investigating the nearby galaxies.  One of the Parsynian astronauts, called R'Hsu, takes on board his spaceship a small female pet Heel.
<p>
The commander of the Missionary fleet is looking for a Matter Source, which he recently learned about thanks to the Announcer.  The fleet arrives in a galaxy overrun by shock waves which damage their interstellar drive.  R'Hsu's Missionary is damaged and forced to leave the Announcer on a deserted planet, along with the Heel, who has been baptized S'Etha-P'Oph'Is.
