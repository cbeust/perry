Eric Weidenburn and his followers are brought on board the Seal Ship, which is surrounded by a thick cloud
of matter.  Threatened to be killed by his disappointed men, Weidenburn is rescued by Jercygehl An.  Weidenburn
assists a race called the Quowocks in defending against the Armada Monteurs.
<p>
Weidenburn's memory is examined and he relives the moment where he had his revelation.  He learns that the
Terrans are suspected of having damaged Triicle-9 and that in order to redeem their faults, they must now
become a part of the Endless Armada.  Weidenburn becomes the official mediator between the two forces
and he receives an Armada Flame.
