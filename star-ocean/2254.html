On March 9, 1332 NGE the SWORD lands on Tan Jamondi II. Lyressea
leads her friends into the Rogan Cathedral. The former center of the
Protector Order is abandoned, most of the technical mechanisms
disappeared and all the databanks, even private computer diaries,
deleted. They do not know, how much was dismantled by the Kybbs,
which they assumed looked for the Paragon Cross here at that time in
the past. However the cathedral seems to hold itself ready, because
no traces of desecration are to be seen. The surroundings also look
maintained, as if there is a gardener at work. Lyressea's hope to
possibly find a reference to the whereabouts of the Paragon Cross
seems to have been futile, until she discovers a small, solar-
powered toy robot, which was once the property of the Protector
Gimgon. Gimgon was the only one, who knew anything about the
disappearance of the Paragon Cross, and he fed this knowledge into
the robot: The Paragon Cross fled to Carya Andaxi on the planet Gray
Foam - in the Arphonie star cluster, which is currently unattainable
by Lyressea and her friends.
<p>
Fortunately there is someone that can help Lyressea. Orrien Alar,
the former guardian of Ancient Trummstam, is still alive. He
outlasted thousands of years, being reborn each time from his own
body after its "death", whereby all his memories were preserved. The
fact that he can no longer remember his own origin points on the
fact that this reincarnation process must have gone wrong sometime,
still before the fall of the Protectors. Orrien Alar had built
himself a hut in the forest within the roots of a giant dead tree
and spent his time maintaining the environment of the cathedral,
listening to the Kybb with a radio and recording everything as into
a recording device. In addition, he tried again and again in vain to
produce a new Ancient Trummstam from seedpods of the old one, which
he had saved. When Atlan and Zephyda seek him out, he is impressed
by the Knight's aura of the Arkonide. They bring him together with
Lyressea, whom he recognizes immediately.
<p>

From the diary recordings of the eternal gardener it follows that
one can reach the Arphonie star cluster using the DISTANCE TRAIL.
Unfortunately these realizations bring Lyressea and their friends
little comfort, because conditions in the Tan Jamondi system
normalize themselves. They would be located immediately, if they
lift off now with the SWORD. In addition twelve Kybb Titans come to
Jamondi through the newly re-established DISTANCE TRAIL, and one
goes into obit around Tan Jamondi II. At least Orrien Alar has
reason for joy: The last seedpod began to germinate; a green tip has
already broken through the soil. For Orrien Alar is that an
indication of the beginning of a new era.
