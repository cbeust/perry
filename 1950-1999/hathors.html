The Hathors are a mysterious race that showed up for the first time at the end of the cycle of the Masters of the Islands (<a href="../mdi/298.html">episode 298</a>). While their intrusion in the plot of the story at this point has been rather controversed, they turned out to be quite an important piece of the cosmic puzzle. They appeared a few more times during the next cycles and unexpectedly made an appearance in the most recent episodes (<a href="1973.html">episode 1973</a>). Here is a brief attempt at reconstituting their history.

<p>

<p>
<p>
Two and a half million years ago, Andromeda was called Hathorja. The Errands, assisted by the Hathors, become the Cosmic Engineers. When the Porleyters disappear, the Cosmocrats nominate the Hathor Terak Terakdschan, father of Tuschnor, Guardian of the Dome. Later, Terakdscan creates the order of the Knights of the Deep and the Errands receive several assignments, mostly building constructions. When the Errands enter the Kesdschan dome on the planet Khrat, they realize that their ancestors are partly Porleyters. The Porleyters had come to follow the movement of the Frost Ruby in Hathorjan but some of them had been torn off by an explosion and their conscienced merged with humanoid primitive creatures.
<p>
For millenniums, the Errands obey the powers of the Order, building bases, weapons and fleets. Then the Hathors start degenerating. A part of the Errands join thirty-five other races and start building a Swarm. The thirty-six people renamed themselves Querionians and then deincarnate into spiritual beings.
<p>
When a supraheterodynamic creature (the Suprahet) threaten the Local Cluster, one million Querionians regain a physical appearance to fight it back. They manage to destroy it. Later, the Hords of Garbesch invad Hathorja. The Hathors, helped by the Querionians in the Milky Way (where they are also known as Petronians, or Galactic Engineers) successfully repell them but many Hathors die. The survivors create the order of the Guardians of the Light. Once the war is over, the remaining Querionians become non-organic again and are now called the Solar Engineers.
<p>
Creatures from another continuum called the Time Surgeons (<EM>Cedric : this information comes from the Atlan miniseries</EM>) attack Hathorjan and exterminate the Hathors. Only two of them survive : Yuga and Marduk Lethos, the parents of Tengri Lethos. A part of the Cosmic Engineers is hired by the messengers of the High Powers to build a new generation of cosmic factories.
