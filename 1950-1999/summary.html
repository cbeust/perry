&nbsp;

<P>The Thoregon coalition is made of the following people :
<BR>&nbsp;
<OL>
<LI>
Gestalter, galaxy Karakhoum</LI>

<LI>
Baolin-Ndas, galaxy Shaogen-Himmelreich, where they live in the Delta-Space,
a hyper-area bubble.</LI>

<LI>
Galornens, galaxy Plantagoo</LI>

<LI>
Nonggos, galaxy Gorhoon</LI>

<LI>
Gharrers, galaxy Chearth (hydrogen breathing)</LI>
</OL>


<P>Each messenger is given a Passantum, a bracelet that allows them to
cross the Bridge of Infinity.

<P>Shabazza, a being capable of changing shapes, fights Thoregon. Shabazza
possesses nine Nano-Columns, stolen from the Baolin-Nda. They're made of
microscopic beings and can be used as weapons. The Nano-Columns were originally
designed for the Messengers of Thoregon.

<P>The Bridge of Infinity is entered through the Mushroom Domes, one
of which emerged on Trokan.

<P>In the past, the Nonggo Messenger died and handed his Passantum to Kummerog,
a criminal, and asked him to relay a message. Using the Passantum, Kummerog
discovered the arsenal that the Baolin-Nda had prepared for Perry Rhodan.
Kummerog destroyed the arsenal and crossed the Bridge of Infinity. He arrived
in the Mushroom Dome of Trokan where he triggered the Timelapse field,
causing the planet to switch to accelerated time.

<P>Rhodan discovers the Bridge of Infinity on Trokan and finds the Passantum
of the fourth Messenger, which Kummerog had abandoned there. He crosses
the Bridge and arrives in the Mushroom Dome on the planet Galorn,
in the galaxy NGC 5949 (this planet is called Plantagoo by its inhabitants).
The Galornen used to be aggressive conquerors but eventually came to a
more peaceful way of life through Dragon Shafts, devices that were able
to harness the aggressive pulses in their minds. Rhodan and Bull eventually
tracks down the Galornen to their hideout, the Pentris Cloud, where they
are busy building Heliotic Fortresses, big space stations that allow Thoregon
members to travel and stay in contact with each other.

<P>On the Galornen world, Rhodan and Bull learn from Helter Baaken that
Ce Rhioton, the Second Messenger of Thoregon, has been missing. As Rhodan
and Bull go to his research, Shabazza attacks the Galornens with Nano-Columns.
He severs the Dragon-Shafts, thus unleashing their primal war instincts.

<P>With the help of the Zentrifaal people, Rhodan fights back the Galornen
and eventually wins, but Plantagoo is now in total chaos. To thank him,
the Galornen leader offers Rhodan a mysterious and extremely advanced blue
spacesuit. Then Rhodan and Bull head for the Baolin Delta-Space, still
looking for Ce Rhioton, the Second Messenger.

<P>Meanwhile, Shabazza keeps attacking the Thoregon coalition. He awakens
Goedda, "the Big Mother". She is a gigantic organism, raised in the galaxy
Suvar by the Nonggos. She eventually turned against her creators and started
depopulating the galaxy. The Nonggos eventually froze her life into a stasis.

<P>While Rhodan and Bull were in Plantagoo, Goedda's offsprings invaded
the Milky Way and occupied a certain number of planets, taking the whole
population under their control. The inhabitants of fifty-two planets died
so that new and more powerful children of Goedda could be born : the Philosophers.
They settled on fifty-two other worlds where they created a bubble in hyper-space
where Goedda could thrive and breed more children. Atlan, helped by Kartanin
Dao-Lin-H'ay and Myles Cantor, eventually succeeds in destroying the area
and Goedda itself. Atlan was also helped by the Herreach, who lured all
the Philosophers into a gigantic black hole before they could create a
new Big Mother.

<P>In 1289 NGZ, a Nonggo convoy sent by Thoregon many years ago reaches
the Sol system. It carries a Heliotic Fortress so that the Terrans can
keep in touch with the Thoregon people. The Fortress is able to swap two
distant areas (called Factor Elements) instantaneously. However, Shabazza
had modified the Terran Fortress in the galaxy DaGlausch. He has discovered
the Dscherros in that galaxy, a very violent people using castle-shaped
ships to ruthlessly destroy any life they encounter.

<P>The Heliotic Fortress is activated and a part of Calcutta is swapped
against a building on the home system of the Nonggos. Also, a nation called
Alashan on Earth vanishes in the process. In its place appears Gousharan,
a Dscherro city. Using hostages and merciless violence, the Dscherros wreak
havoc on Earth and force the Terrans into total surrender. After many fights,
the Dscherros are eventually chased from the Earth and Gousharan is destroyed.
However, saboteurs sent out by Shabazza destroy the Heliotic Fortress.
Calcutta and Alashan are nowhere to be found.

<P>In the galaxy Puydor, sixteen million light-years away from Sol, Shabazza
is readying his next attack against the Terrans. He found a new ally in
the person of Jii'Nevever, also called the Dreamer. Thirty-thousand years
ago, Jii and his brother Guu'Nevever were dominating the minds of their
whole people by controlling their dreams. One of these people, the Varmirens,
fought back and paralized Jii with a new weapon, the Tronizator. Infuriated
by the death of his brother, Guu terminated the Varmiren and chased all
the people of Puydor in their dreams. The Nonggos eventually got rid of
Jii with a time torpedo that created a paradoxal time where they could
keep him prisoner.

<P>In 1238 NGZ, Shabazza kidnapped Michael Rhodan and Julian Tifflor and
turned them into his slaves, implanting a chip in their neck. He sent them
on Curayo, the time prison of Jii, but the two immortals got lost in time.
Shabazza then had Pucky and Icho Tolot free Jii. They discovered Michael
Rhodan and Julian Tifflor for whom 200 years had passed. Rhodan's son had
turned into Torric, the Lord of Time. Together, they freed Jii and the
Puydor galaxy fell into the Dreamer's hands again. Pucky, Tolot and Tifflor
broke loose from Shabazza's control but Michael Rhodan remained his faithful
servant.

<P>The three immortals fight against the Dreamer but they cannot help the
Puydor people. They eventually find Guu who was still captive in the trap
of the Varmiren. Guu fights against his brother but loses, and Jii eventually
absorbs him.

<P>Michael Rhodan and Shabazza ready their assault against the Milky Way
but Tolot, Tifflor and Pucky are able to destroy the fleet with the help
of the Varmirens and the Tronizator. Then they head back to the Milky Way.

<P>Rhodan and Bull cross the Bridge to Infinity in order to meet with the
the Baolin-Ndas but they realize that the access to the Delta Space is
blocked. They leave the bridge in the Mushroom Dome of Kenteullen,
in the galaxy Gorhoon (NGC 5204). They are able to make contact with the
Nonggos and learn about their civilization. The Nonggos have an "SBS-Chip"
implanted in their body that keeps them in contact with the rest of their
people and their knowledge through a central point, the Neuron. The Nonggos
have left their home planet and live now in sphere-wheels that orbit the
Teullers sun. Kenteullen is one of these spheres and this is where Bull
and Rhodan have appeared.

<P>It's also in this place that the north district of Calcutta has appeared
after the Heliotic Fortress incident. The explosion of the Fortress has
awakened the Kont, an aggressor that Shabazza had sent against the Nonggo
many years ago, but Rhodan and Bull are able to destroy it. To thank the
Terrans, Down Kempesch Kort, the new Fourth Messenger of Thoregon, offers
them a new ship, the Kaurrang.

<P>With some inhabitants of Calcutta, Rhodan and Bull fly to the galaxy
Shaogen Himmelreich (NGC 5585), the home of the Baolin-Nda. However, nobody
there knows about Thoregon. The Baolin-Ndas have become monks that worship
the star light from Shaogen, which has stopped shining sixty years ago.
Rhodan meets with Siebenton, the pastor of the Cloud Area, and helps him
to fight his opponents. During the fight, Rhodan and his companions are
stranded on an invisible planet which reveals a transmitter. The Terrans
step into the transmitter and reappear in the Baolin Delta-Space.

<P>The Delta-Space has been devastated and the only survivors are Tautanbyrk
and Viviaree. All the other inhabitants have been the victim of a Nano-Column
sent by Shabazza. But the Nano-Column has also caused the star light of
Shaogen to go out and it also killed Kuntherherr and Ce Rhioton, two Emissaries
of Thoregon.

<P>However, the Virtual Ships, built by the Baolin-Nda and which allow
them to enter and leave the Delta-Space, are still intact.

<P>A Heliot appears in the Mushroom Dome in the Delta-Raum. This spherical
energy creature is a member of the people who builds the Heliotic Fortresses.
It tells Rhodan that he has been appointed as Sixth Messenger of Thoregon.
The Heliot also tells Rhodan that the Sol, Rhodan's former flagship, is
to become his official Messenger ship. However, the ship is in Shabazza's
possession, in the twin galaxies Whirlpool (NGC 5194 and NGC 5195).

<P>On its way to Whirlpool, the Kaurrang is attacked by Tessmas, an insectoid
race sent by Shabazza which corrodes the ship. The Terrans crash on the
planet Salmenghest in the galaxy NGC 5195. The people living on this planet
are from DaGlausch, the bigger component of the twin galaxies. Every ten
or twenty years, the two galaxies intersect and emit very powerful radiations,
also called vibrations. The central point, referred to as the "Cauldron",
cannot be crossed by any ship. Cauldron Vibrations make navigation in this
area of space impossible.

<P>So called Vibration researchers have been investigating this phenomenon
but haven't been able to come to any conclusion. They fear that one day,
a vibration stronger than the previous ones might annihilate their whole
civilization. Eismer Stermengords, a Vibration Researcher, helps the Terrans
and they eventually find out that the Alashan nation has appeared in DaGlausch.

<P>Rhodan eventually locates the Sol on the planet Century I. It has been
transformed by Shabazza on the Cosmic Factory Materia. Shabazza also created
hords of Korrago out of 1-Korrago, their ancestor. With this billion strong
army, Shabazza has taken control of DaGlausch and Salmenghest.

<P>Gia de Molen and Stendal Navajo initially refuse to assist Rhodan but
they realize how dangerous Shabazza when he threatens Alashan. They offer
Rhodan a new ship, the Good Hope III, and a number of their TLD agents
(Gia's former secret service). Reginald Bull and Mondra Diamond take the
lead of the new ship (Rhodan met her during his adventures in Shaogen-Himmelreich
and fell in love with her).

<P>On Trokan, Mhogena appears in the Mushroom Dome. He is the Fifth
Messenger of Thoregon and he came from the galaxy Chearth. He is a Gharrer,
a hydrogen breathing race that left the Milky Way 50,000 years ago to start
up a new peaceful civilization. He has come to Earth to ask help from the
Terrans against the Guan a Var, worm-like creatures that feed upon suns.
He has to plead for the cause of his race to the Terrans who eventually
accept to help him. However, he is attacked by Vincent Garron, the Dead
Mutant, who manages to kidnap him and flees on board the St Amarina.

<P>On board the St Amarina, Vincent Garron is attacked by violent psychic
waves coming from the Fifth Messenger. He eventually comes back to Earth.

<P>Atlan manages to mobilize ten Maahk ships and heads for Chearth with
the Gilgamesh.
