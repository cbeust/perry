<BLOCKQUOTE>200 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>Die StraBe nach Andromeda</FONT></B> 
  <BR>The Path to Andromeda <BR><I>K. H. Scheer</I></BLOCKQUOTE>August 2400. Ichot 
Tolot, a Haluter, arrives on the base of Inversia. The Haluters are an old race 
of warriors, almost indestructible because they can alter their atomic 
structure. 50,000 years ago, they conquered the Milky Way but since then, gave 
up political power and live peacefully on Halut. Tolot found two men from the 
missing Terran ship Omaron and brought them back to Perry Rhodan. These men 
have gone mad, and the disappearance of the Omaron remains a mystery. Rhodan 
leaves on board of the Khrest II in order to find out what happened to the 
missing ship. Tolot joins them. 
<P>They soon discover an artificial system, made of six planets forming a 
hexagon. This system is actually a giant transmitter which sends the Khrest 2 in 
another solar system, 900,000 light years away from the Milky Way and 600,000 
light years from Andromeda. This system, named the Twin System, is also 
artificial : it is made of two stars around which orbit eight planets. Rhodan 
decides to land on a planet -- called Nightmare. They find the remnants of the 
Omaron, with the dead bodies of its crew. Suddenly, Nightmare begins to 
disintegrate. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>201 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>Sternstation im Nichts</FONT></B> 
  <BR>Star Base in the Void <BR><I>Kurt Mahr</I></BLOCKQUOTE>The Khrest II manages 
to take off but its Kalup engines, which can only fly over 600,000 light years, 
are not powerful enough to reach the Milky Way. On top of this, two strange 
phenomena are happening : all the water supplies disappear on board of the ship, 
and six of the seven planets are suddenly protected by an energy field. Only one 
planet -- Hope/Septim -- is accessible, but it looks barren. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>202 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>Die Retter der Crest</FONT></B> 
  <BR>The Rescuers of the Khrest <BR><I>Clark Darlton</I></BLOCKQUOTE>In the Milky 
Way, a rescue operation is set up, thank to Box-8323, a Posbi ship (the Posbis 
are guessed to be the most capable of resisting the transition and escape 
whatever danger lies beyond the transmitter). Box-8323 enters the Sextuple 
transmitter and arrives in the Twin system. They rescue the Khrest II crew just 
before they die out of thirst. Rhodan decides to keep on exploring the planets 
of the system in order to find out how the Twin transmitter can be used to get 
back to the Milky Way. 
<P>Thanks to gravitation bombs, the Khrest II manages to break through the 
energy field of one of the planets -- Athena/Sexta. The Terrans find strange 
devices on the surface but are unable to start them. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>203 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>Die Stadt der Verfemten</FONT></B> 
  <BR>The City of the Outcasts <BR><I>William Voltz</I></BLOCKQUOTE>The terrans 
then explore Thora/Quarta, a planet made of a gigantic city. They find out that 
Thora/Quarta is actually a huge planetary jail populated by criminals from 
Andromeda.

<BLOCKQUOTE>205 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>Der Wächter von Andromeda</FONT></B> 
  <BR>The Guardian of Andromeda <BR><I>H. G. Ewers</I></BLOCKQUOTE>October 2400. 
The Terrans keep on exploring the planets of the Twin system. On Chaos, they 
meet with the Drung, a strange atemporal being, which tells them the giant 
transmitters have been created by so-called Masters of the Island, a race that 
rules over the Andromeda galaxy. The Twins are both a relay to Andromeda, and a 
trap to capture anybody who tries to reach the galaxy. On planet Raum/Quinta, 
the Terrans finally find the main station that controls the transmitter, but it 
is guarded by an army of robots. While the Terrans are fighting them, a giant 
cylindric ship appears through the transmitter and destroys Box-8323. The 
terrans are able to conquer the station and point the transmitter on the 
Sextuple system. Then, the Khrest II fights the cylinder-shaped ship, destroys 
it and dives into the transmitter. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>206 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>Die Schrecken der Hohlwelt</FONT></B> 
  <BR>The Horrors of the Hollow World <BR><I>Kurt Mahr</I></BLOCKQUOTE>At the last 
moment, the pilot of the cylindric ship modifies the settings of the 
transmitter, and instead of going back into the Milky Way, the Khrest II 
materializes inside a gigantic hollow world. This world, baptized Horror World, 
is an artificial planet made of four concentric layers. In the middle is a sun, 
which is where the Khrest II appears. Outside, three suns form a triangle around 
the planet. This artificial system is located 500,000 light years from 
Andromeda, 900,000 light years from the Milky Way and 300,00 light years away 
from the Twin system. The Khrest II barely escapes from energy-eating creatures 
and finds a tunnel through the inner planetary layer. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>207 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>Die 73. Eiszeit</FONT></B> <BR>The 
  Seventy-Third Ice Age <BR><I>William Voltz</I></BLOCKQUOTE>The inner side of the 
second planetary layer, called &quot;green floor&quot; because of the greenish 
light that basks everything, is inhabited by two races : the Kangs and the 
Esquis, who are fighting mercilessly. The Kangs have parapsychic powers that 
neutralize atomic powered machines. The Terrans eventually pull through and 
escape from the Kangs. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>208 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>Die blauen Herrsher</FONT></B> 
  <BR>The Blue Ruler <BR><I>Kurt Brand</I></BLOCKQUOTE>The Khrest II makes its way 
through the second layer using its weapons and reaches the &quot;red 
floor&quot;. This floor is inhabited by Esquis and guarded by three robot flying 
stations that attack the Khrest. Thanks to the mutants, the Terrans are 
eventually able to destroy them. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>209 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>Im Banne der Scheintöter</FONT></B> 
  <BR>In the Thrall of the Bright Dead <BR><I>Clark Darlton</I></BLOCKQUOTE>After 
breaking through the third planetary layer, the Khrest reaches the &quot;yellow 
floor&quot;, where everything seems to have been destroyed by a nuclear war. The 
only survivors are seemingly innocent-looking dogs that actually have 
telepathetic powers, and which take control of the Terrans minds. Once again, 
Gucky and Tolot save the crew and free them from the influence of the animals. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>210 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>Auf den Spuren der Crest</FONT></B> 
  <BR>On the Trail of the Khrest <BR><I>H. G. Ewers</I></BLOCKQUOTE>In the Milky 
Way, the Terrans have built the Prometheus, a ship with an autonomy of one 
million light years. Along with two Posbi ships, the Prometheus goes through the 
Sextuple transmitter and reaches the Twin system. The crew discovers on Chaos 
and Terra indications that the Khrest II was formerly there. On Raum/Quinta, an 
examination of the central station reveals where the Khrest II was headed. The 
Prometheus and the Posbi ships are able to reach the Horror World without having 
to go through the transmitter and arrive there just as the Khrest II, making its 
way through the last planetary layer, eventually breaks free. The Prometheus 
then heads back toward the Milky Way with orders for Julian Tifflor, who is in 
charge of the Terran fleet during Rhodan's absence : to occupy the Twin system 
and dispatch to Horror another long-range ship, the Prometheus II. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>211 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>Geheimwaffe Horror</FONT></B> 
  <BR>Secret Weapon: Horror <BR><I>K. H. Scheer</I></BLOCKQUOTE>Since the Terrans 
have nothing to do while waiting for the Prometheus II, Rhodan decides to 
explore Horror's surface, despite Atlan's warning. The planet seems desert 
except for two big domes on both poles. As the Khrest II is approaching the 
ground, a beam from one of the domes hits them and the ship and its crew are 
miniaturized to 1/1000th of their size. The Khrest II is able to destroy th 
<BR>sout <BR>dome before landing, but is still under the influence of th 
<BR>other reduction field, generated by the south pole dome. 
<P>A wheel-shaped flying fortress, actually 250m wide, then attacks the Khrest 
II, which is forced to flee (it is only 1,5m large). The Khrest II evades the 
fortress but is then stuck on Horror, all the machines being out of order as a 
consequence of their miniaturization. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>212 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>Die Mikro-Festung</FONT></B> <BR>The 
  Micro-Fortress <BR><I>William Voltz</I></BLOCKQUOTE>In order to restore the 
ship's initial size, Rhodan sends a commando to the south pole to destroy the 
dome. The commando is using antique jets, which engines don't seem to be 
affected by the reduction field. However, the aircrafts are attacked by flying 
robots and their pilots only barely make it back to the Khrest II. In the 
meantime, Rhodan learns that the domes were created during the war that once 
opposed the inhabitants of the yellow floor and those on the surface. The two 
people exterminated each other and only the robots remained on the surface. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>213 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>Giganten am Südpol</FONT></B> 
  <BR>Giants at the South Pole <BR><I>H. G. Ewers</I></BLOCKQUOTE>A new raid is 
launched and manages to blow a bomb at the south pole, but the blast is 
insufficient to alter the station significantly. This new attemps fails, and the 
commando once again returns to the Khrest II, chased by the flying fortress. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>214 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>Die Kampf um die Pyramiden</FONT></B> 
  <BR>The Battle at the Pyramids <BR><I>Kurt Mahr</I></BLOCKQUOTE>In the Milky 
Way, the Terrans are still looking for Kahalo, where the central command of the 
Sextuple transmitter is assumed to be. A ship is eventually able to locate the 
planet but the Masters of the Islands dispatch a fleet of cylindric ships 
through the transmitter at the same moment. These ships shoot some sort of death 
ray that destroys all life on the planet, including its inhabitants. The arrival 
of a huge Terran fleet prevents the cylindric ships from destroying the Purple 
Pyramids, where the central station is located. Despite superior firepower, the 
cylinders must flee in front of the Terran fleet. The terrans are now in control 
of the Purple Pyramids. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>215 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>Endstation des Grauens</FONT></B> 
  <BR>Terminal of the Greys <BR><I>H. G. Ewers</I></BLOCKQUOTE>Using the Sextuple 
transmitter, Tifflor occupies the Twin system. In the same time, the Prometheus 
II is approaching Horror but cannot locate the Khrest II, too small to be seen, 
and unable to send radio signals. The Prometheus II then tries to land and 
suffers the same fate as the Khrest II. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>216 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>Aufbruch der Oldtimer</FONT></B> 
  <BR>Departure of the Old Timer <BR><I>William Voltz</I></BLOCKQUOTE>In order to 
warn the Prometheus III, on its way to Horror, so that it is not struck by the 
reduction beam, Rhodan sets up an operation that must go back into the second 
planetary layer and bring back an escape pod that was abandoned there during 
their trip through the planet. The task is daunting, since the humans are only 
2mm tall, but they successfully pilot the ship back to the surface. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>217 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>Gefahr aus der 
  Vergangenheit</FONT></B> <BR>Danger out of the Past <BR><I>K. H. 
Scheer</I></BLOCKQUOTE>February 2401. Using the the giant escape pod, the 
Terrans try to send a message to the Prometheus III, but the message is 
intercepted by the wheel-shaped fortress guarding Horror. The fortress captures 
the Khrest II and the Terrans discover that the inhabitants of the fortress are 
Maahks), a methan-breathing race that once populated the Milky Way. A merciless 
war opposed them to the Arkonids 10,00 <BR>years ago, which was won by the 
Arkonids, thanks to the Converte <BR>Guns <BR>(a gift to the Arkonids by IT). 
The new weapon tilted the war in favor of the Arkonids and nearly all the Maahks 
were exterminated in the galaxy. The survivors fled to Andromeda, and they now 
serve the Masters of the Island. 
<P>The flying fortress departs from Horror and flies through the Horror 
transmitter. Its intent is to attack the Terran fleet on the Twin system. During 
the transition, both the fortress and the Khrest come back to their normal sizes 
(250km for the fortress !). The Khrest II is able to escape from within the 
fortress and joins back Tifflor. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>218 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>Brennpunkt Twin</FONT></B> 
  <BR>Flashpoint: Twin <BR><I>H. G. Ewers</I></BLOCKQUOTE>The flying fortress of 
the Maahks attacks Raum/Quinta. It is protected by an undestructible green field 
and uses the dreadful Converter Guns. The Terrans fight with Transformer Guns 
and giga Arkonid bombs, the only weapons that seem to be able to get through the 
force field. They manage to keep the fortress away and stay in control of the 
Twin transmitter. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>219 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>Teleporter Achtung!</FONT></B> 
  <BR>Attention Teleporter! <BR><I>Kurt Mahr</I></BLOCKQUOTE>After its failure in 
the Twin system, the fortress flies through the transmitters and arrives in the 
Sextuple system. It then proceeds to attack Kahalo. To destroy it once for all, 
Rhodan sends teleporter mutants inside the gigantic ship, where they leave a 
gigabomb. The operation is a success and the fortress is destroyed, but the 
mutants can't make it back to a Terran ship and are strayed in space. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>220 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>Der Tod von den Sternen</FONT></B> 
  <BR>The Dead from the Stars <BR><I>Clark Darlton</I></BLOCKQUOTE>A few Maahks 
were able to leave the fortress before it blew up. They contact the Akonids, 
long time enemies to the Arkonids and the Solar Empire. The Akonids help the 
Maahks to settle on Metha, a desertic methan planet. An Akonid ship captures the 
strayed mutants and turns them in to the Maahks. Once on Metha, the mutants 
escape the Maahks and warn the Terran fleet, which then destroys the Maahk 
colony. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>221 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>Verschleppt nach 
  Andro-Alpha</FONT></B> <BR>Displaced from Andro-Alpha <BR><I>William 
Voltz</I></BLOCKQUOTE>Rhodan decides to send spies within Maahks' ranks. He asks 
five Terran officers, who are doomed by a deadly disease called the Plague of 
the Center. The five men pretend they are deserters and assist the Maahks 
prisoners to escape. Going through the Twin transmitter, they arrive on Horror 
where the Maahk fleet is gathering. Their mission is to collect information on 
the Maahks forces and send them to the Prometheus III, standing a few parsecs 
away from Horror. But the Maahks are not fooled by the stratagem. They send the 
five men through the Horror transmitter to a planet called Androcenter, within 
the Andro-Alpha nebula. Andro-Alpha is a micro-nebula orbiting around Andromeda, 
which is the new home of the Maahks since they fled the Milky Way. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>222 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>Die Döppelgänger von 
  Andromeda</FONT></B> <BR>The Duplicate from Andromeda <BR><I>K. H. 
Scheer</I></BLOCKQUOTE>The Maahks then use a special device called the 
multiplicator. This device allows to duplicate human beings. The clones have all 
the memories of the original, but are under total control of the owner of the 
device. The Maahks are thus able to obtain five clones of the human spies. The 
Terran agents are then executed. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>223 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>Die fünfte Kolonne</FONT></B> <BR>The 
  Fifth Column <BR><I>H. G. Ewers</I></BLOCKQUOTE>The Maahks send back the 
duplicates on Horror, where they join the Prometheus III. They pretend they 
escaped from the Maahks and have vital information to give to the headquarters. 
The Prometheus III brings the duplicates back on Kahalo via the transmitters on 
Horror and Twin. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>224 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>Agenten gegen das Imperium</FONT></B> 
  <BR>Agents against the Empire <BR><I>Clark Darlton</I></BLOCKQUOTE>On their 
return, the duplicates are seen as heroes, except for Atlan, who is fairly 
familiar with the Maahks and can't believe they would have let their prisoners 
escape. He suspects the five agents to have been somehow conditioned by the 
Methanians, but since they are in all points identical to their original 
couterparts, he cannot prove his theory. The duplicates are sent on a shore 
leave on Inversia, on the ship Kitara. Once they're on their way, the agents 
hijack the ship, kill the crew and blow the vessel up, simulating an accident. 
This incident confirms Atlan in his believings. A thorough examination of the 
area where the accident happened reveals nothing. 
<P>In the meantime, the duplicates are joined by an immaterial sphere sent to 
them by the Masters of the Islands. This sphere contains a new device, the Pulse 
Disruptor, that will allow the Maahk ships to use the Sextuple transmitter 
without having to materialize near it. If the Disruptor is activated, the Maahks 
will thus be able to materialize wherever they wish in the galaxy.
