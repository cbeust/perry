<BLOCKQUOTE>250 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>Die sechste Epoch</FONT></B> <BR>The 
  Sixth Epoch <BR><I>K. H. Scheer</I></BLOCKQUOTE>In January 2402, one year after 
the conquest of Androbeta, Rhodan decides to venture into Androbeta with his new 
ship, the Khrest III. This ultracruiser is 2.5km wide and fit with the famous SH 
shield [Cedric: I don't know the original name for this one, I'll just leave the 
initials], identical to the ones used by the Maahks. The Khrest III can go as 
far as 1,2 million light years, and is therefore able to cross the intergalactic 
void. While approaching Andromeda, Rhodan discovers a huge space station the 
size of a big city. The exploration of this station causes the awakening of 
Kalak, the only inhabitant of the city. Kalak is a Paddler. A long time ago, 
these galactic engineers were building space stations that were used as stellar 
stations. But one day, the Masters of the Island decided the Paddlers were 
becoming too powerful and had the stations attacked by one of their enslaved 
races. Kalak's starbase (KA-Supertarif) barely escaped from destruction, but 
only Kalak survived. He plunged himself into an artificial sleep, waiting for 
better days. He is ready to offer the services of his station to the Terrans if 
they accept to help him find other Paddlers.

  Voltz</BLOCKQUOTE>January 2404. Three space ships approach the Terran fleet. 
They come from Ollura, a nearby planet. These ships are very primitive, they fly 
below the speed of light and it took them several years to reach this point. 
They are piloted by dwarves, the Bio-Decomposers. Their technological level 
being very low, Rhodan lets them come aboard, making a dramatic mistake : using 
hypnotic powers, they capture the Khrest III and only Rhodan and a few others 
manage to escape from them.

  <BR>The World of the Regnerated <BR><I>William Voltz</I></BLOCKQUOTE>With the 
Terran crew under their complete hypnotic control, the Bio-Decomposers force the 
Khrest III to go to Ollura. Rhodan follows them there and with Kalak's help, he 
can gain control of the Khrest III and free his men. But tough fights ensue and 
all the Bio-Decomposers must be exterminated. Rhodan fears that the Masters of 
the Island might be alerted that the Terrans have entered their territory. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>253 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>VorstoB in die Dunkelwelt</FONT></B> 
  <BR>Attack on the Dark World <BR><I>H. G. Ewers</I></BLOCKQUOTE>Rhodan simulates 
a nuclear accident on Ollura in order to fool possible Masters of the Islands 
spies there. The plan works : three ships appear to examine examine Ollura, and 
leave. Rhodan decides not to stay around. Respecting the promise he made to 
Kalak, the Terrans set on a search for other stations built by the Galactic 
Engineers. According to Kalak, another station might have escaped to the Masters 
of the Islands by hiding in a nearby gas nebula. The Khrest III follows his 
directions and finds the Emerald system. On its second planet, covered with a 
thick forest, they find a wrecked station. The jungle turns out being a unique 
vegetal being capable of thought, who captures Rhodan and some other Terrans. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>254 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>Die Geistersonne</FONT></B> <BR>The 
  Ghost Suns <BR><I>H. G. Ewers</I></BLOCKQUOTE>As Rhodan and his friends are 
escaping from the Emerald vegetal being, the Khrest III is surrounded by a 
series of hallucinations that make the ship drift away from the second planet. 
The source of these fantasies is identified as coming from Emerald I, where a 
powerful being is trying to hypnotize them. After destroying it, the Khrest II 
gets back on Emerald II. Meanwhile, on the planet, Rhodan finds out that the 
Paddlers who survived the crash have been fighting the Emerald being for the 
past 800 years. With the Terrans help, they escape and destroy Emerald II. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>255 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>Sperrzone Andromeda</FONT></B> 
  <BR>Restricted Zone: Andromeda <BR><I>Clark Darlton</I></BLOCKQUOTE>March 2404. 
Thanks to Kalak, Rhodan gains some knowledge on the Andromeda topography. In its 
center, a 20,000 light years wide sphere is a restricted area. This sphere is 
surrounded by a 500 light years wide crown, home of a people that forbids the 
access to the inner sphere to anyone. This people is called the Tefrodians. 
Rhodan decides to head for the center of the galaxy. 
<P>When they reach the Tefrodians' realm, the Terrans confronts a ship and 
captures four Tefrodians. The Terrans are stunned to see how the Tefrodians look 
like them, not only biologically and physically, but also technologically. The 
four Tefrodians almost escape and are killed in their attempt. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>256 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>Im Reiche der 
  Zentrumwächter</FONT></B> <BR>In the Empire of the Center-Guard <BR><I>Clark 
  Darlton</I></BLOCKQUOTE>Rhodan decides to go on Tefrod, the Tefrodian's main 
planet, to gather information on the Masters of the Island. But the planet is 
closely protected and the mutants do not represent a significant advantage over 
the Tefrodians since these also have mutants. The expedition is a complete 
failure, but Rhodan and the commando are able to escape. Rhodan learns that no 
Tefrodian has ever seen a Master of the Island, except for their chief, the 
Virth, who lives in an extremely well protected island. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>257 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>Der Dreitöter</FONT></B> <BR>The 
  Thrice-Dead <BR><I>William Voltz</I></BLOCKQUOTE>Meanwhile, in Androalpha, the 
rebellion sparked by Grek-1 is gaining in strength. The Maahks rebels have 
defeated those obeying the Masters of the Island, and are now about to attack 
Andromeda. A mosquito departs from KA-Supertarif, now a solar base, to inform 
Rhodan of the latest events, but it is spotted and shot down by the Tefrodians. 
It is marooned on a planet that looks desert at first sight. Further 
investigation reveals that the planet holds subterranean factories where the 
Tedroders create very little spheric devices. The Tefrodians locate the escaped 
crew and try to capture them, but the Khrest III rescues them. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>258 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>Die Mikro-Henker</FONT></B> <BR>The 
  Micro-Hangman <BR><I>H. G. Ewers</I></BLOCKQUOTE>Now aware of the imminent 
arrival of the Maahks in Andromeda, Rhodan decides to step aside to see how the 
confrontation between them and the Tefrodians will turn out. A first stellar 
battle takes place, won by the Maahks. Rhodan takes advantage of the outcome of 
the battle to capture a Tefrodian ship. The members of the ship fight like lions 
and just as they are about to fall in the hands of the Terrans, suddenly drop 
dead. Examining the dead bodies, the Terrans find out that the Tefrodians have, 
implanted in their brain, the small devices discovered previously by the crew of 
the mosquito. These devices allow the Masters of the Islands to have full 
control, including death, over the Tefrodians, even remotely, using hyperwaves. 
During the fight, Rhodan discovered on a desert planet a little robot, calling 
itself Log, who possesses paranormal skills (teleportation and telepathetic). 
<BLOCKQUOTE>259 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>Die unheimliche Roboter</FONT></B> 
  <BR>The Uncanny Robot <BR><I>H. G. Ewers</I></BLOCKQUOTE>As the war between 
Tefrodians and Maahks tilt in favor of the Tefrodians, whose anti-polar gun turns 
out to be more efficient than the Maahks convert guns, Rhodan tries to use the 
captured Tefrodian starship as a Trojan horse to break into their realm. But the 
Tefrodians send this ship for repair through a giant transmitter. The attempt is 
a complete failure and Rhodan and his men will only barely escape. The Khrest 
III, which also went through the transmitter, is uncovered and followed by a 
whole Tefrodian fleet. The Terrans eventually lose their pursuers. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>260 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>Gespenster der 
  Vergangenheit</FONT></B> <BR>Ghost of the Past <BR><I>Kurt 
Mahr</I></BLOCKQUOTE>The Terrans realize that the Tefrodian transmitter actually 
sent them within the forbidden area. As the Khrest III is hiding near a 
planetary system, the Terrans discover a strange planet, inhabited by immortal 
humans that were kidnapped throughout different eras on the Earth. These 
Terrans, completely apathetic, seem to have lost all notions of time. Some have 
been living on this planet -- called History -- for centuries. This human zoo is 
guarded by Tefrodians who are all alike. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>261 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>Die Fabrik des Teufels</FONT></B> 
  <BR>The Devil's Factory <BR><I>Kurt Mahr</I></BLOCKQUOTE>All of a sudden, the 
device that was responsible for the immortality of the inhabitants of History 
stops working, causing their death. Then, the Khrest III is attacked by 
Tefrodians ships. During the skirmish, the Terrans learn that the Tefrodians think 
the Khrest III is actually a Haluter ship. But, according to Ichot Tolot, the 
Haluters don't know about the Tefrodians. Thanks to its transform cannons, the 
Khrest III wins the fight, but heavily damaged, it has to find out shelter on a 
planet called Multika, where a little Tefrodian base is found. As the repairs 
start, a commando is sent out to find more about the planet, and the Terrans 
discover that the Tefrodians possess multiduplicators. This accounts for the 
strange likeness of the guardians of History : the Masters of the Island use the 
multiduplicators to create, in the central area of Andromeda, an army of 
faithful and disciplined clones. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>262 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>Der Meisterplan</FONT></B> <BR>The 
  Master Plan <BR><I>William Voltz</I></BLOCKQUOTE>A little later, while fleeing 
away from the galactic center, the Khrest III attends a fight between Maahks and 
Tefrodians. A strayed Tefrodian ship, the Susama, is then spotted. Kallak thinks 
it might contain multiduplicators, so Rhodan tries to capture it. It is actually 
a trap laid out by the Masters of the Island. The trap succeeds and the 
Tefrodians are able to retrieve the molecular imprints of Gucky, Andre Lenoir and 
Ichot Tolot. To prevent this, Rhodan follows the Susama, which tries to flee 
toward the galactic center. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>263 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>Sieben Stunden Angst</FONT></B> 
  <BR>Seven Hours of Anxiety <BR><I>William Voltz</I></BLOCKQUOTE>With the Khrest 
III hard on its tail, the Susama hides near Big Blue, a blue giant. The 
Tefrodians create a hundred clones of Gucky and Andre' Lenoir, who teleport into 
the Khrest III to capture it. But the Terrans, aware of the threat, are able to 
repel the attack and the Khrest III eventually destroys the Susama. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>264 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>Die Invasion der Toten</FONT></B> 
  <BR>The Invasion of the Dead <BR><I>K. H. Scheer</I></BLOCKQUOTE>Rhodan decides 
to explore Vario, the only planet of the blue giant. But this planet is actually 
another trap laid out by the Masters of the Island : the Khrest III is cast 
50,000 years into the past. Only a small pod is able to escape. The Khrest III 
is then taken to the center of Andromeda where it is sent back into the Milky 
Way through another giant transmitter. It arrives near Kahalo where the crew is 
arrested by a human-like people : the Lemurs. Pretending they are Tefrodians, 
Rhodan and Atlan learn that that have arrived in the middle of the war between 
the Haluters and the Lemurs. These Lemurs possess a huge galactic empire and 
came from a lost continent on the Earth : Lemuria, which was located in the 
Pacific ocean. They are losing the war against the Haluters, and for the past 
century, have been evacuating progressively the Milky Way toward Andromeda 
(where they are called Tefrodians). They are the creators of the transmitters, 
and not the Masters of the Island. Akonids and Arkonids are actually desendants 
from the Lemurian colonies that successfully evaded the Haluters, while the 
Terrans are direct descendants from the Lemurs who could survive on the Earth 
after the war against the Haluters. Thanks to the time transmitter, the Masters 
of the Island were able to create a bridge between the Lemurian's Milky Way and 
the present Andromeda. They have spies among the Lemurs and capture the 
brightest of them to send them into the present, where they are then cloned and 
used are officers in the Tefrodians ranks. 
<P>Striving to rejoin the present, the Terrans (pretending they are Tefrodians 
come back to help their Lemur brothers against the Haluters) talk the Lemurs 
into allowing them to land on the Earth. But the Khrest III is quickly 
identified by the spies from the Masters of the Island on the Earth. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>265 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>Das Zeitauge</FONT></B> <BR>The Eye 
  of Time <BR><I>H. G. Ewers</I></BLOCKQUOTE>While a Terran commando, accompanied 
with Log, is left on Lemur, the Khrest III makes an attempt to get back to the 
present through the time transporter on Kahalo. But the Lemurs have understood 
that the ship is not a Tefrodian ship and prevent it from approaching Kahalo. 
Meanwhile, the Terran commando discovers that the Lemurs have created a time 
device, called the Eye of Time. Thanks to Log's parapsychic skills, the are able 
to capture it. Log then merges itself with the computer that commands the Eye of 
Time, creating a new being: the Drung (see #204). 
<BLOCKQUOTE>266 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>Die Tempel von Darak</FONT></B> 
  <BR>The Temple of Darak <BR><I>H. G. Ewers</I></BLOCKQUOTE>Pursued by a Lemur 
fleet, the Khrest III hides within the galactic center. The Terrans find another 
stellar base of the Paddlers, MA-Genial. The base is also trapped in the past by 
the Masters of the Islands. The Terrans help the Paddlers to repel a Haluters 
attack and the Paddlers become their allies. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>267 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>Rüchkehr in die Gegenwart</FONT></B> 
  <BR>Return to the Present <BR><I>Kurt Mahr</I></BLOCKQUOTE>Hiding near Redpoint, 
a red giant in the galactic center, the Khrest III's crew has no clue as to how 
to rejoin the present. Rhodan sends the Woolver twins on a secret mission to 
capture Frasbur, one of the Masters of the Island, acting as a secret agent on 
Kahalo. The Woolvers attend a meeting between Frasbur and Regnal-Orton, another 
Master of the Island on an inspection visit. They learn that the Masters of the 
Island are humans and have cell activators. An attempt to capture Regnal-Orton 
fails, causing his death. Hiding in the ship of the Masters of the Island, the 
twins are brought back into the present, in Andromeda. There, they join Reginald 
Bell, on board of the supercruiser General Deringhouse who was patroling in the 
Vario area. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>268 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>StoBtrupp in Zeit und Raum</FONT></B> 
  <BR>Shock Troop in Time and Space <BR><I>Clark Darlton</I></BLOCKQUOTE>When 
informed of the situation, Bell decides to dispatch a commando to help Rhodan. 
This commando is made of the Woolvers, Tako Kakuta and Lemy Danger. Using a 
trick, the Terrans bring the Maahks to attack Vario, and use the confusion to 
send the commando into the past. Thanks to the mutants, the commando 
successfully escapes the Lemurs on Kahalo. As Lemy Danger joins the Khrest III, 
Tako and the twins teleport on Kahalo to try to capture Frasbur again. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>269 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>Jagd auf den Zeitagenten</FONT></B> 
  <BR>Hunt for the Time Agents <BR><I>Clark Darlton</I></BLOCKQUOTE>When Rhodan 
learns of the recent events, he sends back Gucky, Lemy Danger and the new 
commando on Kahalo to assist the three mutants. Meanwhile, Kato and the Woolvers 
fall into a trap laid out by Frasbur. The arrival of the commando allows to free 
the three mutants in extremis. Frasbur is captured and everybody gets back to 
the Khrest III. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>270 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>Ultimatum an Unbekannt</FONT></B> 
  <BR>Ultimatum Unknown <BR><I>K. H. Scheer</I></BLOCKQUOTE>Questioning Frasbur, 
the Terrans discover that there is another time transmitter on the sixth planet 
of Vega. This transmitter is less powerful and will only allow time shifts of 
five hundred years in the future. They also learn that Vega VIII, which the 
Terrans visited during the quest for IT in the very first episodes, is a Lemur 
colony that was destroyed by the Haluters. The Ferrolians are thus descendants 
of the survivors, who mutated because of the radiations. The Lemurs are most 
likely the ancestors of all people in the Milky Way. 
<P>The Khrest III is suddenly uncovered and attacked by the Lemurs. Rhodan 
decides to head for the Vega VI transmitter, hoping that in the near future, the 
Lemurs will have been defeated by the Haluters and will no longer be a threat to 
the Terrans. With a surprise attack, the Khrest III destroys the small base of 
the Masters of the Island on Vega VI, activates the time transmitter and leaps 
five hundred years toward the present.

  <BR>The World of the Bodiless <BR><I>H. G. Ewers</I></BLOCKQUOTE>While the 
Terrans are exploring Pigell (Vega VI), they are attacked by weird living 
clouds, which are able to teleport the Terrans to random places on the planet. 
The Terrans eventually join together and, using semi-intelligent dinosaurs 
dwelling on the planet, are able to communicate with the living clouds and make 
peace with them. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>272 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>Flaggschiff in Not</FONT></B> 
  <BR>Flagship in Danger <BR><I>H. G. Ewers</I></BLOCKQUOTE>A new danger arises 
for the Terrans : strange energy-absorber mosquitos neutralize the Khrest III 
while tentacular plants and flame thrower snakes attack them. Rhodan eventually 
finds out that all these attacks are commanded by a cave race of bat-looking 
humans. These creatures, the Icas, actually came from Andromeda. They were 
created by a group of Paddlers specialized in genetics, who were themselves 
genetically modified. They were banned in time and space by the Masters of the 
Island and attacked the Terrans because they confused them with Tefrodians. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>273 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>Unter den Gletschern von

Voltz</I></BLOCKQUOTE>During the fight against the creatures of Pigell, a Terran 
commando is strayed and is forced to flee through a transmitter. The Terrans 
arrive on the Earth, where they meet with the few descendants of the survivors 
of a war against the Haluters. They try to survive on this forsaken Earth, 
wholly covered with ice. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>274 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>Zwischen Feuer und Eis</FONT></B> 
  <BR>Between Fire and Ice <BR><I>William Voltz</I></BLOCKQUOTE>The Masters of the 
Island, alerted that the Vega transmitter was used, take advantage of the 
arrival on the Earth of the Terran commando to lay out a trap for the Khrest 
III. One of them, Toser-Ban, uses the commando as a bait and attracts the Khrest 
III on the Earth, where he tries to destroy it. Thanks to a lucky turn of 
events, the trap fails and the Terran commando is safely rescued. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>275 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>Der Flug nach Barkon</FONT></B> 
  <BR>The Flight from Barkon <BR><I>Clark Darlton</I></BLOCKQUOTE>In the present, 
Mory Abro is worried about the whereabouts of her husband. She has the idea to 
consult the Barkonids. Since Barkon left the Milky Way thousands of years ago, 
its inhabitants might have kept information on the state of the Galaxy at the 
time where Rhodan is. With Bell's help, she prepares an expedition to find 
Barkonis, still wandering between the two galaxies. The expedition first meets 
with Luxids [Cedric: which Rhodan already faced during the Posbi cycle], all 
dead by now, short of finding energy. 
<P>The ship then reaches Barkonis, buzzing with activity, which is unusual. The 
Terrans learn that the Tefrodians arrived shortly before them and proposed to the 
Barkonids to fit generators on the planet, which would allow them to reach the 
Milky Way within a few weeks. In exchange, they asked the Barkonids to take with 
them a race of giant amoebas. The Barkonids accepted the deal. 
<P>The Terrans realize that this whole affair is a trap : the amoebas bear a 
deadly germ that would be fatal to all lifeforms in the Milky Way. Alerted, the 
Barkonids sacrifice themselves by destroying their planet. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>276 - <B><FONT color=#ff0000>Irrweg durch die Zeit</FONT></B> 
  <BR>Lost in Time <BR><I>Kurt Mahr</I></BLOCKQUOTE>To save Rhodan and the Khrest 
III, Bell manages to send into the past via the Vario transmitter a ship, the 
Dino-3, a giant cargo carrying three kalup engines. The end goal is to fit the 
Khrest III with these engines so that it can reach Andromeda without having to 
go though the transmitter, and from there, use the Vario transmitter to get back 
into the present. When the Dino-3 arrives into the past, the Khrest III is no 
longer there. The crew of the cargo ship understands that the Khrest III is five 
hundred years in the future. They abandon the Dino-3 near Redpoint, leaving 
telepathetic beacons in the nearby area, tuned on the mental frequences of the 
mutants, so that only they will be able to unlock the ship. 
<P>Then the men of the Dino-3 board on a pod and set on a five hundred 
light-year trip with a nearly relativistic speed. This way, only a few months 
will have elapsed for them during the actual five hundred years. They hope they 
will find the Khrest III at the end of their journey.

beacons left by the Khrest III. The men of the Khrest III find the cargo ship 
and fit the new kalups. But the Dino pod is nowhere to be found. After fruitless 
searches, the men of the Dino-3 are definitely considered as missing [Cedric: 
actually, they are not dead and will play a key role in a future cycle, but 
their whereabouts won't be explained in this cycle]. 
<P>With its brand new engines, the Khrest III crosses the intergalactic chasm 
and joins Andromeda. On its way, it discovers giant platforms, built by the 
Maahks. These stations are used as relays by the fleeing Maahk fleet. The 
Terrans are witnessing how the initially Andromedan Maahks were chased by the 
arrival of the Lemurs, and how they fleed toward the Milky Way where, 30,000 
years later, they will confront the Arkonids.
