PR406  Nachrichtn aus der Zukunft, Report from the future

Since some years ago, Carsual Band sended a spy to seek how to
produce the Ertru-Cosmobin, which is the only drug to save
Ertrusers from a special illness and is produced only in the
Earth.  After the SOL-system disappeared, the planet Olymp
keeped the supply of the Ertru-Cosmobin.  But the connection to
the spy on the Earth was lost.

In 2nd April 3432, Dr. Tont Tatre found a secret message from
the spy in one bottle of the Ertru-Cosmobin which has just arrived
to the central clinik on the Ertrus. The spy must find the
secret of the Container Street and use it for his report.
Tatre was a grand-grandchild of the famous Ertruser, Malbar Kasom,
who had been a USO specialist and a friend of Perry Rhodan.
So Tatre worked seacretly for the Solar Abwehr.

When Rhodan heared this bad news from Deighton, the chief of 
the Solar Abwehrm, he send two mutants(Gucky and Lloyd) and
one Solar Abwehr agent(Ken Albrich) to the Ertru-Cosmobin 
factory.  They must find a spy from thousands of workers and
researchers.

Finally they found the secret base under the sea and killed
the spy.  The report from the future SOL-system will stop,
but, by then, Tatre was also killed in the battle against the 
Carsual Abwehr.
