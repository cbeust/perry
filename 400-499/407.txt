       H.G. Ewers

Derbolav de Grazia is an cheif of Prospectors.  He found an broken
prospector ship near the planet Obsunthys and obtain the information
on the new element, Ynkelonium.  This element is heavier than Super-
Uranium element and produced only in the Jupiter-type planet Maverick.

Derbolav get necessary equipments from the secret base of Solar fleet
without permission of Anson Argyris, then arrived at Maverick in
18th May 3432. He and his men found old mine that Blues and Tefroders 
had developed and then destroied. In the meanwhile, many Accalauries
gathered to this planet.  Because Ynkelonium has no antimaterial,
they can stay even in atomasphere relatively safely.

Though Derbolav lost his spaceship and many men, he saw real shape
of Accalauries.  But an comunication was not established.  As the USO
fleet recieved Prospectors' SOS and appeared, Accalauries left from
Maverick.

Derbolav gave his right of the Ynkelonium mine to Argyris. This new
element will help the comunication between mankaind in the SOL-system
and the anti-matter race.
