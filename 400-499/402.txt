PR402  UFOs in der Galaxis, UFOs in the Galaxy
       Clark Darlton

Terraners in the ATG field has been supplied from the whole Milky
Way secretly by Posbi.  In October 3431, Box-23114 is destroied
by Accalauries near the positon where SOL-system used to be.
This UFO in the 35th century is a shining energy ball and
nobody knows who or what is in it.

Perry Rhodan recieved SOS from the posbi ship, starts INTERSOLAR
and return to the "nowaday" through the time tunnel.  He chases
the spur of the Accalauries to the planet Salem.

Salem is the Jupiter-type world in the Graper system and rich in
Hogaltan, a kind of rear metal.  Accalauries also seems to be
interested in this metal. Though equipments in the Terran Hogaltan 
mine are also destoried as Box-23114, two leaders of the Terranears,
Howard and Dr. Redskin, have a chanse to observe Accalauries closely 
and find an incredible fact.

Accalauries are anti-matter creatures and their energy field
prevent normal- and anti-matter from contacting and becoming
gamma-ray. By now, there is no way to contact or communicate
with them. So Rhodan order the Howard group to close the mine 
on Salem and return to Terra in the "future".
