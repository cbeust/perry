PR401  Aufbruch ins All, Departure to Universe
       William Voltz

In May 2401, a colonist ship found the Sapa-system, 19316 lightyears 
away from Terra.  Colonists decided to avoid the planet Firmer and 
land its moon Conyers. And 1030 years passed.

Pantalone is the chef of the "first" spaceship of Saparers, VANGUARD.
He and his boss, Makalet, beleave that they could find the trace of
their ancestors on Firmer, who came to Conyers because of the atomic war.
Since all data on Conyers was also lost in this war, Saparers think 
they ware the only race in the universe.

After 7 day's flight, Pantalone and three men reach Firmer and 
take the first step on the jungle of unknown world with a landing ship.
But suddenly the orbital ship of VANGUARD is destoried. Two Saparers
trace the enemy spur and finds an base, where they meet Dabrifaners.
To the Saparers' surprise, Staebler, the chef of Dabrifaners, explain
that there is two thousands race in the Galaxy and that Dabrifaners
will test their new weapon against Conyers.

Pantalone tries to negosiate with Dabrifaners in vain. At the last moment,
an huge spaceship appears in Sapa-system and conquest this base. 
The chef of this ship, INTERSOLAR, resuques Saparers.  His name is 
Perry Rhodan. In 18. May 3431, Saparers meet their ancestors again.
