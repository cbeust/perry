Perry Rhodan negosiated Rapal to use ZERO TIME Deformator to send
Cascal to Mimas before 2909. If he could capture 
Gevoreny Tatsutun
and prevent her from meeting Kitai ishibashi, Corello would not be
born.

After reaching 25th November 2908, Cascal and two Koperniksians 
started for Mimas with a spacejet.  But after about 20000 lightyears
flight, Waringer convertor exploded.  Three agents from the future
tried to repair the hyperlunnar engine in vain.  Finally they ware
resucued by GALAPOLI after three months.

Captain Hammers and the crews of GALAPOLI suspect the Cascal's
speech.  When they return the Sol system, the second genesis crysis
just occurred.  Hammers accepted his fault and order help to chase
Gevoreny. 

After 23000 lightyears chase, Cascal capture her on the second planet
of Gevo system.  But this planet was the secret base of Anti.
GALAPOLI was destoried and Gevoreny could escape.

Only Cascal return to Koperniks and tell Lapal that the past can not 
be changed. He gave all data on his timemachine to Rhodan and killed
himself.
