The container street is the combination of the transmitter and the time 
tunnel, which connects the Ghost system and the planet Olymp.

Olymp is the central world of the free traders. The imperitor, 
Anson Argyris, announced from the hyper-video Trade City to the whole 
Milky Way that he is the official successor of Perry Rhodan and 
that he owns the secret industrial planet of Solar Imperium, which
can provide many products at cheaper prise.  In fact he is the Vario-500 
type bio-positronics robot with the cocon masks and works for Solar 
Imperium secret service.

street on Olymp and to kidnap Argyris to obtain the secret planet.
But Hyubert S. Mauris of Solar Imperium Secret Service found and captured
Dabrifa spies. Kidnapped Argyris also escaped and destroyed the base of 
Imperium Dabrifa. Finally the fleet sended by Dabrifa was overcome by 
No.11 Solar Imperium fleet, which appear suddenly and become under 
control of Anson Argyris.
