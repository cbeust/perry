In June 3586, the Base reaches the galaxy Tschuschik and a communication with some of the inhabitants reveals that Demeter is actually a native of this galaxy.
<p>
On the planet Kschur, Plondfair, a Wyngian, learns that has been chosen to be part of a small elite group destined to fulfill a mysterious task.  The Wyngians are a religious people praying to an entity called the Universal Wheel.  However, Plondfair questions the order and decides he wants to find out what's going on.
<p>
As part of his initiation as a Chosen One, he is taken to Wallzu, one of the moons of the giant planet Valgerspare, where he will eventually be sent.  On Wallzu, Plondfair discovers that instead of being a god, the Universal Wheel seems to be an alien device.  He is discovered by the prisets of the Wheel, called the Kryns, and is forced to flee.
