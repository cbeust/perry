Thanks for his four Spoodies, Mallagan's abilities increase and he realizes that the kidnapping of the game master was a simulation destined to infiltrate the Brotherhood.  He organizes his escape along with some other candidates who were kidnapped as well.  Some of them die during the attempts and their Spoodies disappear.
<p>
The potential candidates for the Lugosiade are presented to the Duke Gu, a celebrity who recently arrived on board his spaceship, the Kranos 1.  Mallagan manages to pass the qualifying rounds but his behavior becomes more and more erratic.
