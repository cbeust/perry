Tolot and Tosen are finally free of Seth Apophis' influence and they enter the mysterious crystal wall.  Inside, they discover a maze and they are attacked by a fleet of small creature that infiltrate their spaceship and attempt to destroy it.  Tolot manages to expel them using ultrasounds.
<p>
They finally emerge from the maze and discover an artificial landscape made of plains and mountains.  They land on an astroport where they find spacehsips of various shapes.  They meet a Phygo called Arrheed, who shows them that they are surrounded by debris.  Arrheed, who came from the planet Phynascour, was brought here against his will and is now a prisoner.  His task is to remove an <em>Anchor</em> from its position, but he doesn't have any more details.
<p>
Tolot and Athosen receive the mission to go in the debris field and bring back a sample from a region from which nobody has ever come back.  When they get close to the mysterious sample, Tolot's glove leaves his hand, grabs a sample of the ore and brings it back to the Halutian.  On the way back, Tolot has the vision of a tall and colorful creature.
