The Porleyters land in Terrania and take control of the Cosmic House, after demonstrating the power of their Kardec shields.  Callamon sneaks out with the two Darghetians and hides them in caves.  Rhodan and the Sol arrive on the Earth and decide to collaborate with the Porleyters, hoping they will give up their hostile attitude and will disclose more information on the Frost Ruby.
<p>
Clifton Callamon is found unconscious, with all memory of the location of the Darghetians erased.  On the Sol, Seneca comes up with a plan to have all the major positions in the Terran government occupied by personalities under Seth Apophis' influence within a year.
<p>
A mysterious individual named Kitsaiman appears and leads the resistance against the Porleyters.  He claims he is the one who hid the Matter Controllers and he seems to have mutant abilities.
