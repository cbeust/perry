PR409  Der Mann, der doppelt starb, The man, who died twice
       Clark Darlton

On the return from planet Vinzsa, Rhodan sended Goratschin to
Anchorot, a new colony of Ross Coalition.  When Goratschin and
Skopins, an agent of Solar Abwehr went to the secre
t base on this
planet, Corello send powerful hypno impulse and huge robot army.
After the combat, Skopins found Goratschin was almost dead.

Goratschin was send to Olymp, then to Ghost-system. Gucky join this
trip to take care of him.  When they reach the Mercury, they found
someone was hiden in Goratschin's body and escaped.  Corello made
Troj's horse and send his anti agent, Hashey to spy Ghost-system.

Though Hashey destroied energy station for the time-tunnel, Gucky and
Deighton chased him.  At last moment, Corello's hypno order killed
Hashey.  Rhodan could obtain little information on the super mutant.
