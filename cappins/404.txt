who see him face directly lost his sense and life.

They are waiting for Tipa Riordan, the Pirate Lady.  She owns 3000 ships
and made attacks on the Rhodan's enemies such as Dabrifa.  Now one of
her ship was destroied by a mysterious ship.  She managed to win this
enemy and find that supermutant Ribald Corello is behind the event.
