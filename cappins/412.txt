PR412  Gefahr von Sol, Danger from Sol
       H.G.Ewers

Oberst Sockmann sends the alrrm to Argyris that there occurrs an extra
powerful explosion at the edge of Squirepankin-system.  One ship of
Accalauris must be distroied in an a
ccident and survaivals may need
help.  Perry Rhodan has been prepared to contact with this anti-material
creatures.  He and Waringer order to cover an experiment ship ROLIN
with Maverick-Cape, which is made of pure Ynkelomium and prevents
normal- and anti-matter from contacting and exploding.

After a few trial, Terraners succeed to save Accutron Mspoern and
his robot Lobbyhuvos.  They are took to Kallisto and given a special
house. Anti-Oxygen is reproduced from Anti-Carbonoxide with the
machine protected by Maverick-Cape. Accalauris can live only on
the light of the sun without any food.  So four weeks passed since
Mspoern came to Sol-system.

On 5th October 3432, Mspoern calls for Rhodan and talks that 
Sol shows unnormal and unstable behaiver so it may change into a nova
in any time.  ROLIN approch Sol and it is found that something
artificial has affected on Sol. But hypno impulse  from this "Death 
Satellite" and Sol itself( gravity and heat ) prevent Terraners from
approaching more closely.

The implus from Death Satellite is the same kind as the Tonga undersea 
base where Load Zwiebus was found.  So his memory blocked is the
only one key to answer who builded this satellite about 200000 years
ago.
