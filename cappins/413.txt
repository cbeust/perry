Hi, list.

I lost much time in this month to write this summary.
May the next issue take less time than this one. ;->

PR413  Die Sonnenforscher, The sun researcher
       H.G.Ewers

Deighton and scientist of Terra tried to break though the hypno
barrier in the brain of Load Zwiebus.  He had in fact seen the builder
of the "Death Satellite", but more information can not be obtained
without the menace of his life.

On Olymp, a terraner physist, Jussow, was rescued from agents of
Dabrifa Imperium by Anson Argyris.  He was a stuff of the special
ship SUN-DRAGON.  On 19th November 3442, he and Waringer, 
with Load Zwiebus and Accutron Mspoern, went deeply into 
the atomosphere of Sol.  They found the "hyper-physical void" 
and dumbbell-shape object in it. The transform cannon can not 
penetraite this space.  Moreover, this satellite send a kind of
emotio-radiation and all c
rews of SUN-DRAGON lost normal sense.
Only Accalaurie kept his sense and could excape SUN-DRAGON with the
help of the positronics.

After the report of sun researchers, Rhodan said that, though this 
"Death Satellite" can not be destroyed form outside, we have 
a chance in the past to prevent it from being built. We need
another ZERO TIME Deformator at once.
