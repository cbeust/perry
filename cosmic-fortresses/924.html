Back on his homeworld, Zwottertracht, Boyt Margor realizes that the psychodes he destroyed when he left were actually fakes.  The real ones were hidden somewhere in the mountains by a Vincranian called Zalinorg.  They find a couple of psychodes, one of them being the one that originated the Dancing Virgin.
<p>
On Gaia, Hotrenor-Taak, still under Margor's influence, organizes a psychode exhibition which soon allows Margor to take everone under his control, including Roctin-Par.  Margor learns that Gota, his female companion, is expecting a baby from her.  Furious, Margor chases her and the woman, considerably weakened by the psychode radiations, eventually dies.
<p>
Margor manages to locate the galactic position of Iota-Tempesto and he organizes a vast migration across the Milky Way to have all his paraslaves gathered in the dark cloud.
